Case Management
===============

.. _case_management:



Working with data is a central part of any modeling application. Data
can come from external sources or from AIMMS' proprietary case files.
This chapter introduces AIMMS' capabilities with respect to creating and
managing a collection of case files. Furthermore, AIMMS' capabilities of
working with data from multiple case files, both from within the
language and from within graphical data objects on end-user pages, are
illustrated.

.. rubric:: Not in this chapter

AIMMS uses a proprietary binary format for case files to store data
compactly, quickly, and easily. This propietary format makes case files
unsuitable to exchange data with other programs. AIMMS' capabilities to
exchange data with other programs is documented in the Language

Furthermore, the :doc:`dataexchange/index` is the prefered way nowadays to exchange 
data between AIMMS and other softwares or applications, notably through a REST API.
