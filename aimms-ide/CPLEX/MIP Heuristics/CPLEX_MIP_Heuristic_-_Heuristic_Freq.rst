Heuristic Frequency
===================



:Type:	Integer	
:Range:	{-1 .. 2147483647}	
:Default:	0	



The value of this option determines how often to apply the periodic heuristic. Setting the value to â€“1 turns off periodic heuristic. Setting the value to 0, the default, applies the periodic heuristic at an interval chosen automatically. Setting the value to a positive number applies the heuristic at the requested node interval. The heuristics used are somewhat different than the heuristics used with a fixed heuristic frequency.



**Note** 

*	The behavior of CPLEX is undefined if both this option and the option **Heuristic Effort**  are set to non-default values. These two options should not be used together.
