Network Extraction Level
========================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Try reflection scaling	



This option establishes the level of network extraction for network simplex optimizations when **LP Method**  is set to "Network + Primal"or "Network + Dual". The default value is suitable for recognizing commonly used modeling approaches when representing a network problem within an LP formulation. Possible values are:



*	Extract pure network only
*	Try reflection scaling
*	Try general scaling
