Multi Objective Presolve
========================



**Type** :	Selection	

**Range** :	The settings listed below	

**Default** :	Automatic	



This option controls the initial presolve level used for multi-objective models. Possible values are:



*	Automatic
*	Off
*	Conservative
*	Aggressive




The default value 'Automatic' usually applies presolve conservatively. Aggressive presolve may increase the chance of the objective values being slightly different than those for other options.
