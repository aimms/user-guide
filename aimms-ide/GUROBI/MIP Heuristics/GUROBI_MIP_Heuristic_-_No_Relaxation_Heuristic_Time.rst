No Relaxation Heuristic Time
============================



**Type** :	Floating point number	

**Range** :	[0,1e100]	

**Default** :	0	



This option limits the amount of time (in seconds) spent in the No Relaxation heuristic. This heuristic searches for high-quality feasible solutions before solving the root relaxation. It can be quite useful on models where the root relaxation is particularly expensive.



Note that this option will introduce non-determinism - different runs may take different paths. Use the **No Relaxation Heuristic Work**  option for deterministic results.



**Note** 

*	This option only affects MIP models.
