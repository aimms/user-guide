.. _GUROBI_Simplex_-_Norm_Adjust:


Norm Adjust
===========



**Type**:	Integer	

**Range**:	{-1 .. 3}	

**Default**:	-1	



This option chooses from among multiple pricing norm variants. The default value of -1 chooses automatically.



This is an advanced option. The details of how this option affects the simplex pricing algorithm are subtle and difficult to describe and therefore there is no description of the values 0 - 3. Changing the value of this option rarely produces a significant benefit.
