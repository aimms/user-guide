Relative Pivot Tolerance during Ratio Test
==========================================



:Type:	Floating point number	
:Range:	[1e-10,1e-6]	
:Default:	1e-8	



This option specifies the relative pivot tolerance during ratio-tests. During ratio-rests, the lower bound on the slope of a basic variable to potentially leave the basis is RPT * the largest term in the computation of the tangent. Here RPT denotes the value of this option.
