Relative Pivot Tolerance during Ratio Test
==========================================



**Type** :	Floating point number	

**Range** :	[1e-10,1e-6]	

**Default** :	1e-8	



This option specifies the relative pivot tolerance during ratio-tests. During ratio-rests, the lower bound on the slope of a basic variable to potentially leave the basis is RPT * the largest term in the computation of the tangent. Here RPT denotes the value of this option.
