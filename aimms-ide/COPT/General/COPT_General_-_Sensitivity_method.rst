Sensitivity Method
==================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Automatic	



This option specifies which method is used by COPT for solving LP problems while calculating sensitivity ranges. Possible values are:



*	Automatic
*	Dual simplex
*	Barrier
*	Concurrent




See the option **LP Method**  for a description of the algorithms.





Multiple LP problems are solved to calculate shadow price ranges for constraints and value ranges for variables. See :ref:`Miscellaneous_Calculation_of_Shadow_Price_Ra`  for more information.
