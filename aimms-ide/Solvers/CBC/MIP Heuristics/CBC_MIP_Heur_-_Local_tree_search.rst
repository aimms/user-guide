Local tree search
=================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Off	



This option determines whether to use the local tree search heuristic. Setting 'On' switches on a local search algorithm when a solution is found. This is from Fischetti and Lodi and is not really a heuristic although it can be used as one. When used inside CBC it has limited functionality. Possible values are:



    *	Off
    *	On
