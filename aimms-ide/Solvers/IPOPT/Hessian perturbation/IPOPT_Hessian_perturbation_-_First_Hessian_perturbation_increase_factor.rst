First Hessian perturbation increase factor
==========================================



:Type:	Floating point number	
:Range:	[1,1e+019]	
:Default:	100	



This option sets the increase factor for x-s perturbation for the very first perturbation. The factor by which the perturbation is increased when a trial value was not sufficient - this value is used for the computation of the very first perturbation and allows a different value for for the first perturbation than that used for the remaining perturbations.
