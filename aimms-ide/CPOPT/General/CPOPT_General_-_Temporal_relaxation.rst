Temporal relaxation
===================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	On	



This advanced option can be used to control the usage of a temporal relaxation internal to the invoking CP engine. By default the relaxation is used in the engine when needed. For some models, using the relaxation becomes inefficient, and you may deactivate the use of the temporal relaxation. 



Possible values are:



    *	Off
    *	On
