Crash Method
============



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Pnewton	



In the first phase of the solving algorithm, PATH can use a crash procedure that attempts to quickly determine which of the inequalities should be active. In PATH the projected Newton direction ('Pnewton') is used as crash method. This option defines whether or not PATH should use the crash procedure. If the value of this option is 'Automatic' PATH itself chooses. Possible values are:



*	None
*	Automatic
*	Pnewton
