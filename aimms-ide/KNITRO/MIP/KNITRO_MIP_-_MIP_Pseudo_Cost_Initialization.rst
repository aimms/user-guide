MIP Pseudo Cost Initialization
==============================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Automatic	



This option specifies the method used to initialize pseudo-costs corresponding to variables that have not yet been branched on in the MIP method. Possible values are:



*	Automatic
*	Average value
*	Strong branching




Setting 'Average value' implies that the pseudo-costs are initialized using the average value of computed pseudo-costs.
