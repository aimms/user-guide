Barrier MPEC Heuristic
======================



**Type**:	Selection	

**Range**:	The settings listed below	

**Default**:	Off	



This option specifies whether or not to use a heuristic approach when solving MPEC models with the barrier algorithm. Possible values are:



*	Off
*	On




In some cases enabling this heuristic can speedup the convergence to the solution and provide a more precise solution on MPEC models (e.g., models with complementarity constraints).
