Barrier MPEC Heuristic
======================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Off	



This option specifies whether or not to use a heuristic approach when solving MPEC models with the barrier algorithm. Possible values are:



*	Off
*	On




In some cases enabling this heuristic can speedup the convergence to the solution and provide a more precise solution on MPEC models (e.g., models with complementarity constraints).
