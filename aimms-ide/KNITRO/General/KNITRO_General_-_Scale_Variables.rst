Scale Variables
===============



**Type** :	Selection	

**Range** :	The settings listed below	

**Default** :	None



This option determines the strategy that Knitro applies for scaling variables. If scaling is performed, internal computations, including some aspects of the optimality tests, are based on the scaled values, though the feasibility error is always computed in terms of the original, unscaled values. Possible values are:



*	None
*	Based on bound values
