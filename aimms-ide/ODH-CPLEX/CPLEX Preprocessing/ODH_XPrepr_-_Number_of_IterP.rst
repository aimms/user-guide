Number of Iterations in Presolve
================================



:Type:	Integer	
:Range:	{-1 .. 2100000000}	
:Default:	-1	



The setting of this option determines the number of presolve iterations made. When set to a non-zero value, CPLEX will invoke presolve to simplify and reduce problems. When set to a positive value, the presolve will be applied the specified number of times, or until no more reductions are possible. At the default value of â€“1, Presolve should continue only if it seems to be helping.
