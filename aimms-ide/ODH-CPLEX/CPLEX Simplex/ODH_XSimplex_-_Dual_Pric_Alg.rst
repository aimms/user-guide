Dual Pricing Algorithm
======================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Determined automatically	



This option can be used to select the pricing algorithm for the dual simplex method. While the default pricing usually provides the fastest solution time, many problems benefit from alternative settings. Possible values are:



    *	Determined automatically
    *	Standard dual pricing
    *	Steepest-edge
    *	Steepest-edge in slack space
    *	Steepest-edge, unit initial norms
    *	Devex pricing
