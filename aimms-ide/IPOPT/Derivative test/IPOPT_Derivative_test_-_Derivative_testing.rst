Derivative testing
==================



**Type** :	Selection	

**Range** :	The settings listed below	

**Default** :	Do not perform derivative tests	



This option enables the derivative checker. If this option is enabled, a (slow!) derivative test will be performed before the optimization. The test is performed at the user provided starting point and marks derivative values that seem suspicious. Possible values are:



*	Do not perform derivative tests
*	Test first derivatives at starting point
*	Test first and second derivatives at starting point
