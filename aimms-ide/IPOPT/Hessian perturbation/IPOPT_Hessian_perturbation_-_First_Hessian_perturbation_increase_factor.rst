First Hessian perturbation increase factor
==========================================



**Type** :	Floating point number	

**Range** :	[1,1e+019]	

**Default** :	100	



This option sets the increase factor for x-s perturbation for the very first perturbation. The factor by which the perturbation is increased when a trial value was not sufficient - this value is used for the computation of the very first perturbation and allows a different value for for the first perturbation than that used for the remaining perturbations.
