Complementarity tolerance
=========================



:Type:	Floating point number	
:Range:	[1e-010,1e+019]	
:Default:	0.0001	



This option specifies the absolute tolerance on the complementarity. Successful termination requires that the max-norm of the (unscaled) complementarity is less than this threshold.
