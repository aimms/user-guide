Dual infeasibility tolerance
============================



**Type**:	Floating point number	

**Range**:	[1e-010,1e+019]	

**Default**:	1	



This option specifies the absolute tolerance on the dual infeasibility. Successful termination requires that the max-norm of the (unscaled) dual infeasibility is less than this threshold.
