Option 'd'
==========

**Usage** :	CompLis <filename1> <filename2> -d	



If this option is set then CompLis will check whether some constraint appears more than once in the first file. CompLis always checks whether some constraint appears more than once in the second file, but the check for the first file is skipped by default.



Note that in a normal AIMMS constraint listing each constraint is printed once. Since this check is time consuming it is therefore skipped by default.
