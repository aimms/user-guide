Variable selection
==================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Off	



The option determines whether to use costs or column order as priorities. Setting 'Absolute cost' orders the variables in order of their absolute costs - with largest cost ones being branched on first. This primitive strategy can be surprisingly effective. The column order option is obviously not on costs. Possible values are:



    *	Off
    *	Absolute cost
    *	Column order
