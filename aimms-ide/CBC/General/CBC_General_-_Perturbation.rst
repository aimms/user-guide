Perturbation
============



**Type** :	Selection	

**Range** :	The settings listed below	

**Default** :	On	



This option determines whether to perturb the problem. Perturbation helps to stop cycling, but CBC uses other measures for this. However large problems and especially ones with unit elements and unit rhs or costs benefit from perturbation. Normally CBC tries to be intelligent, but you can switch this off. Possible values are:



*	Off
*	On
