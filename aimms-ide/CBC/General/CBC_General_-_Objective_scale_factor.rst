Objective scale factor
======================



:Type:	Floating point number	
:Range:	[-1e+20,1e+20]	
:Default:	1



This option specifies the scale factor to apply to the objective. If the objective function has some very large values, you may wish to scale them internally by this amount. It is applied after scaling. You are unlikely to need this.
