Dual feasibility tolerance
==========================



:Type:	Floating point number	
:Range:	[1e-20,1e+12]	
:Default:	1e-7	



For an optimal solution no dual infeasibility may exceed the value of this option. Normally the default tolerance is fine, but you may want to increase it a bit if a dual run seems to be having a hard time.
