Scaling
=======



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Automatic



This option enables or disables model scaling. Scaling can help in solving problems which might otherwise fail because of lack of accuracy. It can also reduce the number of iterations. It is not applied if the range of elements is small. When unscaled it is possible that there may be small primal and/or dual infeasibilities. Possible values are:



*	Automatic
*	Off
*	Equilibrium
*	Geometric
