.. _option-CBC-rhs_scale_factor:


RHS scale factor
================



:Type:	Floating point number	
:Range:	[-1e+20,1e+20]	
:Default:	1



This option specifies the scale factor to apply to rhs and bounds. If the rhs or bounds have some very large meaningful values, you may wish to scale them internally by this amount. You are unlikely to need this.
