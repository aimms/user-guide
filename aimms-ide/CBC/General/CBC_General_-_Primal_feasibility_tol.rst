Primal feasibility tolerance
============================



**Type** :	Floating point number	

**Range** :	[1e-20,1e+12]	

**Default** :	1e-7	



For an optimal solution no primal infeasibility may exceed the value of this option. Normally the default tolerance is fine, but you may want to increase it a bit if a primal run seems to be having a hard time.
