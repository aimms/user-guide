:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Standard reduced cost pricing	



This option determines the basis pricing strategy. If the number of iterations required to solve your model is three times the number of constraints, then you might want to consider to use infeasible and/or feasible devex pricing. Possible values are:



*	Standard reduced cost pricing
*	Automatic devex pricing switch over
*	Infeasible devex pricing
*	Feasible devex pricing
*	Both infeasible and feasible devex pricing
