=========



**Type** :	Selection	

**Range** :	The settings listed below	

**Default** :	Primal simplex	



For solving an LP, three methods can be applied: primal simplex, dual simplex and barrier. The barrier method works best for most LP problems. Possible values are:



*	Primal simplex
*	Dual simplex
*	Barrier




**Remark** 


When the barrier method is used for solving an LP problem no sensitivity information, like shadow prices and reduced costs, is available.
