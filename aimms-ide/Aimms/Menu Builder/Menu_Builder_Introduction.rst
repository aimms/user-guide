Menu Builder Introduction
=========================

**Description** 

The Menu Builder (containing the Menu Tree) is one of the seven basic AIMMS tools. 
To customize the menus on the pages for an end-user application, AIMMS is equipped with a Menu Builder. 
The Menu Builder is a tool to construct and maintain your own customized menubars, 
toolbars and popup menus on a per-project basis. Every page in your project can be equipped 
with a customized menubar, toolbar and popup menu and further more, 
every object on a page can be equipped with its own right-mouse popup menu. 
All menubars, toolbars and popup menus are maintained in a single Menu Tree.
