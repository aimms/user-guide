Page Navigation Items
=====================

**Description** 

A page navigation item can be used in a popup menu and will display a structured set of menu items that allows the end-user to navigate through a set of pages. The structure of the pages displayed is identical to the structure as defined in the Page Manager. When the user selects a menu item that was created implicitly through a page navigation item, the corresponding page is opened.



**Note** 

*	A page navigation item has at least one (read-only) action that corresponds to opening the selected page.
*	AIMMS has two limitations on the usage of Page Navigation items:

1.	The total number of Page Navigation items in all of the popup menus of a menubar is limited to 40.


2.	For each individual Page Navigation item, the total number of pages to which it refers is limited to 250.
