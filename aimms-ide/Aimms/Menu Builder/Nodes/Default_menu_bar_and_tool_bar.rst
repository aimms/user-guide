Default Menu Bar and Tool Bar
=============================

**Description** 

When making pages you can use the Menu Builder to customize the user menubar, toolbar and popup menus that are associated with that page. If you do not specify your own customized menus, AIMMS will display a default menubar and a default toolbar for a page in user mode. The default menubar and toolbar contain no project specific action but only general AIMMS actions that are applicable to every project.



After opening the Menu Builder, you will see that the Menu Tree always contains the default menubar and default toolbar. These two bars are read-only and cannot be edited (which is indicated by the grayed-out icons). Components of this default menubar and toolbar can serve as building blocks for your own customized menubars, toolbars and popup menus.
