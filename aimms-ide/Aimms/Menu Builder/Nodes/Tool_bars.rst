Tool bars
=========

**Description** 

A toolbar is an optional horizontal bar positioned just below the menubar of a page, containing a row of bitmap buttons. In most common applications, each toolbar button corresponds to a specific command in the accompanying menubar, and the buttons provide an easy access to the mostly used commands.

By default, there is no space between two adjacent buttons. However, using separators you can create a small spacing between two buttons, and thus create groups of related buttons.
