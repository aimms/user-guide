Copies vs Duplicates
====================

**Description** 

In the Menu Builder you can create Duplicates of existing nodes (and all children below these nodes). Duplicates of a node can appear at multiple positions in the tree, but they all share the same node properties and children. Thus if you change a duplicate node, the same change applies to all duplicates of that node. Duplicates are especially handy if you want to include the same menu item in multiple popup menus, or if you want to include exactly the same popup menu in various menubars.

Nodes that are duplicates of each other, are always exactly the same. If you plan to have a (slight) difference between two nodes, you should copy the node instead of making a duplicate.



**Note** 

*	In AIMMS, there is no distinction between the original node and the duplicated nodes. Thus, after creating a duplicate node it makes no difference whether you modify (or delete) the 'original' node or the 'duplicated' node.
