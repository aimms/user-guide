Menu Items
==========

**Description** 

A Menu Item is that entry in a menu, that, if you select it, actually executes a specific command. In AIMMS the commands that can be executed are similar to the actions that can be defined for a button on a page.

In the Menu Builder, you can insert new menu items as children of a popup menu and thus define the contents of such a popup menu. Additionally, menu items can be inserted as children of a Toolbar node. In that case, the menu item nodes will not be translated into menu items, but into Toolbar buttons. Thus, in the Menu Builder, there is no explicit difference between menu items and toolbar buttons: the position of the menu item node in the tree defines it appearance.
