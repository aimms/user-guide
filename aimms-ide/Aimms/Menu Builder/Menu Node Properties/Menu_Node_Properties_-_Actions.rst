Actions
=======

**Description** 

The Action tab of the Properties dialog box is only applicable to menu items and page navigation items in the Menu Builder. On this tab, you specify which actions should be executed when the user selects the corresponding command in the menu (or presses the button in a toolbar).

The Action tab for nodes in the properties dialog box of the Menu Builder is similar to that of the Button or Navigation object in a page. You can include any of the following types of actions:

*	:ref:`Button_Action_Opening_Pages`  
*	:ref:`Button_Action_Running_a_Procedure`  
*	:ref:`Button_Action_Performing_a_Menu_Comma`  
*	:ref:`Button_Action_Update_an_Identifier`  
*	:ref:`Button_Action_Closing_the_Current_Pag`  
*	:ref:`Button_Action_Opening_Help`  
*	:ref:`Button_Action_Performing_Assertion_Ch` 




**Note** 


For a Navigation Item node, the actions for opening a page are not available. Instead, there is one default action in the list, namely: 'Open the Selected Navigation Page'. This action opens the page that corresponds to the menu item that is selected, and cannot be removed from the list. You can however, add other actions before or after this default action.
