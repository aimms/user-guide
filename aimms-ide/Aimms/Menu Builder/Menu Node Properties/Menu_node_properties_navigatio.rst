Navigation
==========

**Description** 

The Navigation tab is only present for Page Navigation nodes in the Menu Builder. On this tab, you can specify which part of the Page Manager Tree should be used to generate the navigation menu items. Similar as for a Navigation object on a page, you can define a specific subtree of pages to be displayed. Each page in this subtree will appear as a separate menu command in the menu. When the user selects any of these commands, the corresponding page will be opened. Optionally, you can specify other actions that must be executed just before or after the opening of the page (see the Actions tab).



**Include Hidden Pages as Disabled** 

If this property is turned on, hidden pages will be shown disabled. You will not be able to jump to the hidden pages ( but you can jump to child pages of these pages). If this property is turned off, hidden pages and children of hidden pages will not be shown in the navigation menu.
