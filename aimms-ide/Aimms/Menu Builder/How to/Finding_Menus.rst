Find Menus
==========

**Description** 

As in all other trees of AIMMS you can use the Find command from the Edit menu to search for a specific string in any of the tree nodes. Additionally, you can search for identifiers that are used in the properties of the tree nodes.

To find the set of Menu Tree nodes that depend on some specified AIMMS identifiers:

1.	Open both the Model Explorer and the Menu Builder.

2.	In the Model Tree, select the identifiers, procedures, etc, you want to search for.

3.	Drag the selection to the Menu Builder.

AIMMS will now highlight all the nodes in the Menu Tree that refer to at least one of the selected identifiers.



**Note** 

*	You can also drag selected identifiers from a View Window, or drag a selector node from the Identifier Selector window to find identifiers in the Menu Builder.
*	In the Model Tree, you can select individual identifier nodes, but you can also select a whole section so that you can search for all the identifiers contained within that section.
