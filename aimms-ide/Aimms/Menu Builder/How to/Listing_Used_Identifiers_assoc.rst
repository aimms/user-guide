List Used Identifiers Associated with Menu Tree Nodes
=====================================================

To find out which identifiers are associated with a certain menubar, toolbar, popup menu, menu item or separator.

1.	Select a node in the Menu Builder.

2.	From the Edit menu, select the command Used Identifiers.



A listbox will appear showing the identifiers that are used on the selected menu node. To inspect whether some used identifiers are actually private (and not accessible) on a specific location, an extra column is available that shows the 'Accessible' status: either 'Yes',  'Yes (private)' or 'No'. If 'No' the entry is also displayed in red, since this is regarded as an error. The dialog contains a 'Show Where...' button. When pressing it, the menu builder will highlight all items that use the currently selected identifiers.
