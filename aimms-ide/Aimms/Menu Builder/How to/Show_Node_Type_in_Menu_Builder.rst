Show Node Type
==============

**Description** 

Each node type in the menu builder is represented by a bitmap. If you are not yet familiar with the bitmaps, you can also show the node types in the menu builder by selecting Show Node Type from the View menu. The name of each node type is then displayed in a bold font in front of the name of the node itself.
