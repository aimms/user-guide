Manipulate the Menu Tree
========================

**Description** 

The structure of all menubars, popup menus and toolbars, that you create, is represented in the Menu Tree, which is displayed in the Menu Builder. There is a natural resemblance between the structure of menus and the hierarchy of a tree, so creating the menus and toolbars using a tree is very intuitively.

Using the standard mechanisms in AIMMS to modify a tree, you can:

*	add new nodes (representing new menus, menubars, toolbars, menu items, etc.),
*	delete nodes,
*	move and copy nodes and subtrees,
*	create duplicates of nodes and subtrees, and
*	edit the specific properties of each node.




When you first open the Menu Builder, the Menu Tree contains only the default menubar and the default toolbar. These two items are read-only and cannot be deleted. You can, however, use (parts of) these default tree as building blocks of your own menubars and toolbars.
