Preview Menu Bars, Tool Bars and Popup Menus
============================================

**Description** 

While working with the Menu Builder it is possible to preview (or test) a menubar, toolbar or popup menu without having to open a page to which it is attached.



To preview a menubar, toolbar or popup menu.

1.	Open the Menu Builder.

2.	In the tree, select the menubar, toolbar or popup menu to be previewed.

3.	From the View menu, select Preview.

The Menu Test window will appear, containing the selected menubar, toolbar and/or popup menu.

4.	You can browse through the menus and select any of the commands. The commands are not actually executed, but instead, a description of the command is displayed in the window.

5.	Close the preview window to exit the previewing process.



**Tips & Tricks** 

*	You can use the Menu Test window to check whether all buttons in a toolbar have a (correct) tooltip text, or whether all menu items have a (correct) status line help text.
