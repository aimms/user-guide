Link Menus to Pages or Page Objects
===================================

**Description** 

For menubars, toolbars and popup menus to be used in an end-user application, they have to be linked explicitly to a page or page object. This link has to be specified on the page or page object itself and cannot be specified from within the Menu Builder. The menubars, toolbars and popup menus are only applicable for a page that is in User Mode. A page in Edit Mode always uses the standard menus and toolbar for editing the page.



**Tips & Tricks** 

*	If you want to inspect how the resulting menubars, toolbars and popup menus look-like without linking it to a page or page object, you can at any time use the preview command. The preview command opens a special window, showing the selected menubar and/or toolbar.
