Introduction
============

**Description** 

The Model Explorer (containing the Model Tree) is one of the seven basic AIMMS tools.



The Model Explorer provides you with a simple graphical model representation. All relevant information is stored in the form of a tree, referred to as the Model Tree, which can be subdivided into named sections to store pieces of similar information in a directory-like structure. The leaf nodes of the tree contain the actual declarations, procedures and functions that make up the core of your modeling application.



**Note** 

*	Besides the tree represtenation of your model, it is also possible to look at a selection of identifiers using the Identifier Selector or a flat file representation of (part of) the model.
