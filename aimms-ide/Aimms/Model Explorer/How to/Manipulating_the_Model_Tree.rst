Manipulate the Model Tree
=========================

**Description** 

The Model Explorer offers you all the necessary tools to create and maintain your AIMMS model. In the Model Tree, you can declare all the identifiers, procedures, functions and sections for your model. Because all these model components correspond to nodes in the tree, adding these declarations corresponds to creating nodes of a specific type in the tree. Similarly, you can use other tree manipulation functions such as delete, copy, move and rename to change (the hierarchy of) these model components.



When starting a new model, the Model Tree contains only 

*	a single, empty declaration section,
*	a ``MainInitialization``  procedure,
*	a ``MainExecution``  procedure, and
*	a ``MainTermination``  procedure.




For simple applications, this skeleton is usually sufficient to construct your model, but of course you are free to modify the tree by adding new nodes, deleting nodes, renaming nodes, and copy or move nodes to other locations.
