Import part of the model
========================

**Description** 

You can import part of your model from another model source file.

1.	In the Model Explorer, create a new section or select a section that you want to overwrite.

2.	From the Edit menu, select Importâ€¦

3.	In the file selection dialog box, enter the name of the model file that you want to import

AIMMS will display a dialog box that informs you of how the imported file will affect your current model (stating which identifiers will be added, deleted, or modified). 

4.	Press the OK button to confirm, or press Cancel if you want to interrupt the import action. If the imported file contains identifiers that are already declared in other parts of the model, then the import action will always be canceled.



**Note** 

*	You can also import a file using the Source file attribute of a section.
