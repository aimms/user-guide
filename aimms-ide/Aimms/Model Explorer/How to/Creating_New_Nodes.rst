Create New Nodes
================

**Description** 

To create a new node in the Model Tree

1.	Open the declaration section in which you want to insert a new node,

2.	Select an existing node below which you want to insert a new node,

3.	From the Edit menu, open the |img_def_New_Identifier_Node_button_bmp| Insert submenu and select the node type to be inserted.

4.	Specify the name for the new node.

5.	Press the ``<Enter>``  key (or press the ``<Esc>``  key to abort the operation).



**Note** 

*	At any position in the Model Tree, pressing the ``<Insert>``  opens a dialog box from which you can select the node type that you want to insert. The dialog box only lists those node types that are allowed at the current position in the tree.
*	When you insert a new procedure or function node, you are allowed to add arguments right away. When any arguments have been added, AIMMS will open the Argument Wizard. 




**Tips & Tricks** 

*	The toolbar contains creation buttons for the most common node types. You can select the |img_def_Insert_button_bmp| button to select any node type available at the current position.
