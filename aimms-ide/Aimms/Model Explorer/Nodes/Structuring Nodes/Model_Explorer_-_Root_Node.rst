Root Node
=========

**Description** 

The Main Model node forms the root of the Model Tree. The main model is represented by a box icon that opens |img_def_Root_Node_Open_bmp| when the Model Tree is expanded, and can contain module sections, book sections, declaration sections, procedures and functions. You cannot delete the main model node, nor create a new model node. You can, however, change the name of this node or alter its attributes.

The attributes of the model node are:

*	``CONVENTION``  : The unit convention that you enter here determines the default convention that is used in the interface or for data exchange with external components. You can specify a convention explicitly, or implicitly via a string parameter in the pre-declared set AllConventions..
*	``COMMENT``  : In this field you can place any comment. A good idea is to give a short global description of the model for future reference.




**Note** 

*	The name of structuring nodes in the model tree can be used in the model, for example to empty parts of the model at once.
