Declaration Section Node
========================

**Description** 

Declaration section nodes are used to group identifier declarations of your model. Declaration sections are represented by a scroll icon, and can only contain identifier declaration nodes.

A declaration section node itself does not have a specific meaning in your model, and therefore it does not have specific attributes. The single attribute that you can specify is:



*	``COMMENT``: In this field you can place any comment. A good idea is to give a short global description of the contents of the declaration section for future reference.
