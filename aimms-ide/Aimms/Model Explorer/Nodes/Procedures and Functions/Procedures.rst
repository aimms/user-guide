Procedures
==========

**Description** 

Procedures (and functions) are the main means to execute the sequential tasks in your model that cannot be expressed by simple functional relationships in the form of identifier definitions. Such tasks include importing or exporting of your model's data from or to an external data source, the execution of data assignments, and giving AIMMS the instructions to optimize a system of simultaneous equations.

Via the GUI you can let the end-user execute procedures, giving him control over the AIMMS model. Procedures can not only be associated with Buttons, Menu Items and Navigation Objects, but can also be called when a Page is opened/closed or a change/selection is made in a Page Object.
