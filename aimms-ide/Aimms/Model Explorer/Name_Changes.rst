Name Changes
============

**Description** 

AIMMS helps you in dealing with the possible consequences of name changes by offering the following support:

*	AIMMS updates all references to the identifier throughout the model text, and in addition,
*	AIMMS keeps a log of the name change, so that when AIMMS encounters any reference to the old name in either a page, menu or in a case file, the new name can be substituted.

To rename a node in the model tree, select the node and select Rename from the Edit menu, or press F2.





**Note** 

*	If an identifier name is used in the text of the attribute Comment, then it is only renamed if it is surrounded by single quotes.
