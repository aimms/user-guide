Page Navigation
===============

**Description** 

By default, all child pages belonging to a page are linked together in a cyclic, double-linked list which defines the previous and next relationship. To divide the set of child pages you can insert a Page Separator between any two consecutive child pages.



AIMMS offers the possibility to attach Goto Page actions to a button or a menu item. Executing a Goto Page action will open the parent page, next page, previous page or (first) child page of the current page.
