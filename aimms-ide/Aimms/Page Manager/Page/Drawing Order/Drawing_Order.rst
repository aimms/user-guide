Drawing Order
=============

**Description** 

When you have two or more drawing objects that (partially) overlap, you can change the drawing order to determine which object should be visible.

Data objects are ignored in the drawing order: they will always appear on top of the drawing objects they overlap. If two data objects overlap each other then you have no control over which object should appear on top, and it may lead to strange effects. It is therefore advised not to let two data objects overlap, unless you specify that one of them should be hidden.
