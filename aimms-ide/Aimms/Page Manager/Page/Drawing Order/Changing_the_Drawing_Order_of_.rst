Changing the Drawing Order of Objects
=====================================

To change the drawing order of objects:

1.	Open the page in edit mode.

2.	Select the object for which you want to change the drawing order.

3.	From the Edit menu, select Drawing Order - Front or Drawing Order - Back.



**Note** 

*	If you set an object to the Front, it will be drawn as last and is thus completely visible.

*	The appearance of data objects is not affected by this command. They are always drawn on top of drawing objects.
