Used Identifiers
================

To get a quick overview of all the model identifiers that are used in a page object:

1.	Open page in Edit Mode.

2.	Select the object(s) for which you want to show the identifiers.

3.	From the Edit menu, select Used Identifiers.



**Note** 

*	When no object is selected, the dialog box will show the used identifiers for all objects on the page, plus the identifiers that are used in the properties of the page itself.
*	Identifiers that are used in menus, toolbars or right-mouse menus of an object are not listed in this command. For this purpose, the Menu Builder offers a similar menu command.
