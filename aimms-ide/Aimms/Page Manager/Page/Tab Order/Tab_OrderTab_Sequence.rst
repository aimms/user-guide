Tab Order/Tab Sequence
======================

**Description** 

On the Miscellaneous property tab of an object, you can decide whether an object should be in the tab sequence. Besides deciding if an object should be in the tab sequence or not, you can also decide on which position in the tab sequence it should be. This can be done using the Tab Order dialog box. In the Tab Order dialog box the objects with a tag name will be represented by their tag name, the objects without a tag name will be represented by their type.



All objects on the template of a page will have one position in the tab sequence of that page. The individual order of the different objects on the templates can be set in the Tab Order of the template itself.



**Note** 

*	The first object in the tab order will get the focus when the page is opened in end-user mode.
