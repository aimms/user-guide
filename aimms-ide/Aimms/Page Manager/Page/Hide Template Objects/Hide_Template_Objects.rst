Hide Template Objects
=====================

**Description** 

During the construction or modification of a page it is possible to show only the objects that are not inherited from the templates of the page. This option has no effect on a page in User Mode. If you want to see what a page looks like without templates in end-user mode, you should (re)open the page in the Page Manager via the command Open – Without Templates in the Edit menu, and then switch to end-user mode.



To hide template objects:

1.	Open page in Edit Mode.

2.	From the View menu, select Hide Template Objects.
