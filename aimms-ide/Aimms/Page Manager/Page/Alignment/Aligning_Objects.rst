Aligning Objects
================

To align object to left, right, top or bottom:

1.	Open page in Edit Mode.

2.	Select the objects you wish to align.

3.	From the Edit menu, select Alignment - Left, Right, Top or Bottom.



**Remark** 

As a reference the smallest rectangle will be used that includes all selected objects. For example when you align two objects to the left, after the alignment the left side of both objects will be at the same horizontal position, which is the position where the most left object was before the alignment. In case the alignment leads to overlapping data objects, you will get a warning. Overlapping data objects may result in unwanted behavior of the objects.
