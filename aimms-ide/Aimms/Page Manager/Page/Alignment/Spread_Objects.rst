Spreading Objects
=================

To spread object horizontally or vertically:

1.	Open page in Edit Mode.

2.	Select three or more objects you wish to spread.

3.	From the Edit menu, select Alignment - Spread Horizontally or Spread Vertically.



**Remark** 

The selected objects will be spread over the size (horizontal or vertical) of the smallest rectangle that includes all selected objects. The objects will be ordered so that the object most to the left (with horizontal spreading) or most to the top (vertical spreading) will come first. The top and left side of the objects are used as reference for this ordering. Spreading means that the distance between each two objects will be made equal. The distance between objects might be negative; in which case the overlapping between each two objects will be equal. In case the spreading leads to overlapping data objects, you will get a warning. Overlapping data objects may result in unwanted behavior of the objects.
