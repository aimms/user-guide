**Description** 

In AIMMS, the building blocks of an interactive report are pages. A page is a presentation of data that can also include descriptive text and links to other pages. On a page, there can be different types of objects. An object is an area within a page that can contain graphics, figures, text, tables and buttons. Not only can you change the contents of a page by adding objects or changing properties, you can also link it to a template from which the page will then inherit part the contents and properties.
