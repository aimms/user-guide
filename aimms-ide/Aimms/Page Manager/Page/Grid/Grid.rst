Grid
====

**Description** 

Each AIMMS page is equipped with an invisible grid, which can be used for aligning the page objects. If you use the same grid on every page, you make it easier to position objects on the same position at every page.

If you use the grid alignment on a page, then:

*	all corners of a newly created object will be set to the nearest grid point,
*	the top-left corner of a moved or copied object will be set to the nearest grid point, and
*	the corner that you drag during the resizing of an object will be set to the nearest grid point.




If (temporarily) you do not want to use the grid for creating, moving or resizing an object, you can switch off the grid alignment in the View menu.





**Note** 

*	The default grid on a newly created page is set to 6 pixels (both horizontally and vertically).
*	The grid 'starts' at the top-left corner of the page.
*	Changes to the grid settings only apply to the current page.
