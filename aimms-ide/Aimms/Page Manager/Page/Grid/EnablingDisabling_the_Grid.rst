Aligning to the Grid
====================

**Description** 

You can temporarily enable or disable the alignment to the grid via the Use Grid command from the View menu.



**Note** 

*	When you (re-)enable the grid, the objects already on the page will not automatically be aligned to the grid. It is however possible to align these objects to the grid by moving or resizing.
