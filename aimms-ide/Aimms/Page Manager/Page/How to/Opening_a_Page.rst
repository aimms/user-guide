Opening a Page
==============

When developing an AIMMS application, you have two ways to open a specific page in your application (in addition to opening pages using the buttons and menus of the application itself).



Opening a page via the Page Manager (or Template Manager):

1.	Open the Page Manager (or Template Manager)

2.	Select the page you want to open in either the Page Tree or the Template Tree.

3.	From the Edit menu, select Open - In User Mode |img_def_User_Mode_button_bmp| or In Edit Mode |img_def_Edit_Mode_button_bmp|. 



Opening a page via the File menu:

1.	From the File menu, select Open â€“ Page.

In the dialog box:

2.	Select the page you want to open.

3.	Click Ok.



Alternatively, a page can also be opened by double clicking on the page in the Page or Template Tree. When double clicking on a page in the Page Tree, the page will be opened in User Mode while when double-clicking on a page in the Template Tree, the page will be opened in Edit Mode.



**Note** 

*	When a page is opened in User Mode, the focus will be on the first object in the tab order.
*	In the Open Page dialog box, you can choose to display all pages in a list (instead of a tree). This list has an additional column containing the last modification date of each page. You can sort all the pages in the list based on their name or modification date.
