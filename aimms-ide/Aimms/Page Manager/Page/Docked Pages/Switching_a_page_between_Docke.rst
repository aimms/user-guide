Switching between Docked and not-Docked
=======================================

Once you have enabled the property 'Allow User Dockable' of a page, you can switch the page from being contained in the Document Area and being docked.

There are two ways to do this:

1. By selecting the command **Show Docked**  from the **View**  menu, or

2. By right-clicking on the title of the page, and selecting the **Show Docked**  command.



The first time that a page is being docked, its position is rather arbitrary, but as a next step you can drag it to any position within the current layout of docked windows, or even drag it as a floating window. The floating window feature can be especially useful when working in a multiple monitor setup, since you can drag these pages to another monitor as well.



With the page property 'Always Docked', you can assure that a page is always shown in the docked mode, and an end-user cannot switch it back to the Document Area. 



Docked Pages become part of the current layout, but when :ref:`Miscellaneous_Saving_and_Restoring_Layouts`  a docked page will by default not be part of the saved layout. If you do want a docked page to be saved and restored automatically upon re-opening the project, you must specify this explicitly in the page properties by enabling the option 'Include in Saved Layout'.
