Moving a Split Line
===================

To move a Split Line:

1.	Open the page in Resize Edit Mode.

2.	Select the Split Line you want to move.

3.	Drag the Split Line to its new position.



**Remark** 

If other split lines depend on the position of the line that you are moving, it is often not possible to move the line to any position you want. AIMMS will not allow you to move the line to an invalid position.
