Menu

**Description** 

On the Menu Properties tab you can set the following properties:



**Menu Bar** 

This option lets you specify which menu bar will be displayed when the page is in User Mode. You can explicitly select the default or a user-defined menu bar for the page, or you can choose to let the page inherit the menu bar from its template. If the page does not have a template or if the template itself has not specified an explicit menu bar, then the default menu bar is used.



**Right-Mouse Popup Menu** 

With this property you can specify an optional right-mouse popup menu for the page. This menu is shown whenever the page is in User Mode and the right mouse button is clicked anywhere in the page, unless you click in a page object for which another right-mouse popup menu is defined. If you want a right-mouse popup menu on your page, you can either select it explicitly for the page, or let the page inherit the popup menu from its template. If you choose to inherit the popup menu, but the page does not have a template or if the template itself has not specified an explicit popup menu, then the page will not have a popup menu.



**Toolbar** 

With this option you can specify an optional toolbar that will be displayed when the page is in User Mode. You can explicitly select the default or a user-defined toolbar for the page, or you can choose to let the page inherit the toolbar from its template. If you choose to inherit the toolbar, but the page does not have a template or if the template itself has not specified an explicit toolbar, then the default toolbar is used.

 

**Remark** 

Whether a page has a toolbar or not has an effect on the position of all the opened windows within the application. To avoid that windows appear on different positions while switching pages, it is best to use a toolbar on all pages or on no page at all.
