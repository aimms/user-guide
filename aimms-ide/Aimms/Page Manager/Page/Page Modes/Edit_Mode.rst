Edit Mode
=========

**Description** 

The Edit Mode (or design mode) is the mode in which the properties of the page and the page objects can be changed. The only property of the page that cannot be changed in this mode is its resizability; this can be changed in the Resize Edit Mode.



To open a page in Edit mode:

1.	Open the Page Manager.

2.	Select the page you wish to open.

3.	From the Edit menu, select Open in Edit Mode |img_def_Edit_Mode_button_bmp| or double click on the page and change to Edit Mode by selecting Edit Mode |img_def_Edit_Mode_button_bmp| from the View menu.



**Remarks** 

If a page has a 'user defined' menu that is created in the Menu Builder and this menu does not contain the Edit Mode command, then you can not switch to Edit Mode using the menu (or F4). For this reason, in the developer mode of a project AIMMS will always generate an extra first button on the end-user toolbar of a page, so that you can still switch to Edit Mode easily. If you choose not to display a toolbar at all, then you can switch the page from User Mode to Edit Mode only by closing the page and re-opening it in Edit Mode from the Page Manager or Template Manager.
