Out-of-date Pages
=================

**Description** 

Pages can become out-of-date as a result of changes in the model (deletion or renaming of identifiers or procedures). Pages that were created with a previous version of AIMMS are also considered out-of-date. Pages that are out-of-date are indicated with an exclamation mark in front of the page in the Page Tree.



To update these pages to the current AIMMS version:

1.	Open the page in edit mode |img_def_Edit_Mode_button_bmp|,

2.	Save the page |img_def_save_button_bmp|.

3.	Close the page.
