Opening the Property Dialog Box
===============================

To open the property dialog box for a page object:

1.	Make sure that the page is in Edit Mode.

2.	From the Object menu, select Select |img_def_select_button_bmp|.

3.	Select the object by clicking on it with the mouse.

4.	From the Edit menu, select Properties |img_def_Properties_button_bmp| (or double click on the object).



**Tips and tricks** 

*	When you select multiple objects on a page, AIMMS allows you to simultaneously modify some of the properties that are applicable to all of the selected objects. In that case, the Properties dialog box will only display the property tabs that are shared among all selected objects. Initially, none of the property values in these tabs is filled in. Only the properties that you actually change will be applied to selected objects.
