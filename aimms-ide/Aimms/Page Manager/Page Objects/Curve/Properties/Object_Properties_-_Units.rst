Units
=====

**Description** 

For each identifier in an object you can specify the unit in which the value should be displayed and where the unit should be displayed in the object. You can use the default unit (from the model identifier); a specified unit or you can let a convention determine the units that should be used in the page object. The units can be displayed in the title, at each value or not at all. The square brackets enclosing the units are optional. It is also possible to override the unit string that is being displayed via a static string or a quoted text.



**Note** 

*	Units and conventions are explained in detail in the Language Reference.
