**Description** 

In the Contents tab of the Curve properties dialog box, you can modify the X-axis identifier, and add, remove or modify the Y-axis identifiers. If you specify multiple Y-axis identifiers, then these identifiers should all be one-dimensional with a domain that matches the X-axis identifier.

Besides the identifiers that are displayed as curve lines, you can also add scalar identifiers that will be displayed as straight horizontal or vertical lines (for example, to indicate critical bounds).

When adding identifiers to the curve you should first select the proper position in the current list of identifiers, so that it is clear what type of identifier you want to add. When you want to add a horizontal line, you should select the horizontal lines line or one of the horizontal lines before clicking the Add button. If you want to add an Y-axis identifier, you need to select one of the existing Y-axis identifiers.



**Note** 

*	You can also add identifiers to a curve by switching the page to edit mode and selecting and dragging multiple identifiers from the model tree into the curve.
