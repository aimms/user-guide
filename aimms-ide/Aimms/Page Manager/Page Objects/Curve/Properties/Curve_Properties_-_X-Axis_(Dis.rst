X-Axis (Discrete)
=================

**Description** 

On the X-Axis tab of the curve properties dialog box you can specify how many elements you want to display along the X-axis. You can either specify that all the elements of the set should be displayed, or enter a fixed maximum number. If you enter a maximum number, then only the first part of each curve line is shown. The remaining part of the curves can then be reached by scrolling the Curve horizontally.
