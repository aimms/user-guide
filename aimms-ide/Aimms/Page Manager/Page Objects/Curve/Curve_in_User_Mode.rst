User Mode
=========

**Description** 

Although the Curve object is especially designed for displaying data, it does allow the end-user to make modifications in the data. If the curve object has a status line at the bottom, you can select a point on a curve line, and modify the value the current Y-axis value in the edit field of the status line. Additionally, you can drag a point to a new position. If the curve has a discrete X-axis (showing element along the X-axis), you can only drag the point vertically. If the curve has a continuous range, then you can drag the point both horizontally and vertically (unless the corresponding identifiers are not updatable).



**Note** 

*	You can only change the value of an identifier if the curve is not read-only and if the identifier is in the set CurrentInputs, which generally means that the identifier should not have a definition.
