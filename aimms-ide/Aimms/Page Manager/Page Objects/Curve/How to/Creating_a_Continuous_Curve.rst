Creating a Continuous Curve
===========================

To create a continuous curve on a page:

1.	While in Edit Mode, select Curve |img_def_Curve_button_bmp| from the Object menu.

2.	On the page, drag a rectangle where you want the curve to appear.

The Curve dialog box appears on the screen.

3.	In the Y-Axis Identifier field, enter an identifier or select an identifier in the Identifier selection dialog box. 

4.	Select Identifier and in the Identifier field, enter the identifier that you want to use for the continuous range on the x-axis or select this identifier in the Identifier selection dialog box.

5.	Click Ok.



**Note** 

*	The Y-axis identifier must be either one-dimensional or two-dimensional.
*	The X-axis identifier should be one-dimensional, and its free index should match with one of the free indices of the Y-axis identifier.
*	If the Y-axis identifier is two-dimensional, then the other free index determines the number of individual curves lines that will be displayed. Each of these curves has its own color, which is presented in the legend of the curve.
*	If you select a one-dimensional Y-axis identifier here, you can add additional Y-axis identifiers later on using the Contents tab of the properties dialog box.
