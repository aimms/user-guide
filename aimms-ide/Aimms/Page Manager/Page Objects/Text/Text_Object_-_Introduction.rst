Text Object Introduction
==========================

**Description** 

With the text object, you can add textual information to your pages. You can display the contents of a file, the contents of a scalar string parameter, or just static text.



**Note** 

*	The drawing objects on a page (rectangles, circles, lines, text and pictures) may overlap each other, and you can use the menu item Edit – Drawing Order to decide which object is 'on top'. All other objects on the page (tables, charts, etc.) will always be displayed on top of any drawing object.
*	If the text is too long to fit into the specified rectangle, then the remaining text is cut-off and cannot be made visible. If you want to display a scrollable piece of text on your page, then you should use the multi-line capabilities of the Scalar object.
