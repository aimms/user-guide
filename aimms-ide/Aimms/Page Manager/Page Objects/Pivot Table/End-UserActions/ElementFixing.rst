Element Fixing
==============

Making an index an outer index will reduce the dimension of the pivot table. Another way of reducing the size of the pivot table is to fix one or more indices. To fix an index to a certain value you should
 

*	switch to 'fixing' mode by pressing the filter button |img_def_Button_-_Filter_jpg| in front of the row or column area,
*	check the elements you want to restrict to by pressing the checkboxes |img_def_Button_-_Checkbox_jpg| in front of these element, and
*	switch back to 'normal' mode by pressing the filter button |img_def_Button_-_Filter_jpg| once again.




Once a certain index has been fixed to a specific value, this fixed element will be equipped with a 'drop-down' button |img_def_Button_-_Drop-down_jpg|. When you press this button a drop-down list appears that allows you to fix the index to some other element.
