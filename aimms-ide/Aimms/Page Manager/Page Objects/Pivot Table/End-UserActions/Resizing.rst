Resizing
========

As an end-user you can adapt the width of the columns in the pivot table, that is, the width of the headers in the row area as well as the width of cells in the column area. Besides these, you can also adapt the width of the outer indices. To adapt the column width you should pick up the right border of the cell to be resized and drop it when the selected cell has the desired size. Whenever you pick up a cell that is not on the deepest level in the tree, all predecessor cells are automatically rescaled to together fit the specified width. When you doubleclick on the right border of a cell to be resized, the pivot table will automatically resize the selected cell (including all its predecessor cells) such that every column will be just as width enough to fit all grid values. If you always want the automatic resizing to take into account the width of the header, you should hold down the control key while double clicking.
