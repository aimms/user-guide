Outer Area
==========

On the Outer Area tab you can specify various font and color settings of the Outer Area. 



**Same as Row Area** 



With this option you can make sure that the Outer Area will behave and be displayed exactly the same as the Row Area. By default it is set to 'Yes'. If you set it to 'No', then you have to specify all properties for the Outer Area seperately from the Row Area. In other words: if 'No', none of the properties will be inherited from the Row Area.
