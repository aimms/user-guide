Grid Area
=========

On the Grid Area tab you can specify various font and color settings of the Grid Area.



**Background Color** 



With this property you can set the background color for the grid area. If you leave it empty, then the grid area will have the same color as specified on the General tab. If both this property and the background color on the General tab are left empty, then the grid area is transparent (showing the background color and drawing objects that are on the underlying page). Please note that there are other properties to specify the background colors for individual cells in the grid. 



**Alternating Background Color** 



With this property you can specify an alternating background color for the grid area. If specified, any second row in the grid area will be colored using this color. Especially in pivot tables with a lot of columns the use an alternating background color improves the visibility of the data. By default, the alternating background color is set to light gray. Please note that there are other properties to specify the background colors for individual cells in the grid. 



**Text Color** 



With this property you can set the text color for the grid area. Please note that there are other properties to specify the text colors for individual cells in the grid. 



**Line Color** 



With this property you can set the color for the lines between the grid cells. 



**2nd Line Color** 



If specified, all lines between entries that do not share the same parent in the row or column tree will be colored differently. 



**Font** 



With this property you can set the font for the grid area. All entries in the grid will use the same font with one possible exception: you can specify a specific font for the aggregator values in the grid.



**Selection - Background Color** 



With this property you set the background (or highlight) color for the currently selected cells in the grid.



**Selection - Text Color** 



With this property you set the foreground color for the currently selected (and highlighted) cells in the grid.



**Aggregators - Background Color** 



With this property you can set a special background color for aggregator rows or columns in the grid.



**Aggregators - Text Color** 



With this property you can set a special text color for aggregator values in the grid.



**Aggregators - Font** 



With this property you can set a special font for aggregator values in the grid. It is recommended to use a font that is similar in size as the default grid font, because the size of all grid cells will adjust to the largest of the used fonts.



**Header Row or Columns - Background Color** 



If either the row or column tree is showing subheaders, the grid will contain corresponding empty rows or column. With this property you can set a special background color for these empty rows.



**Show Tooltips** 



With this option you can specify whether you want to see tooltips when you hover the mouse over the individual grid cells. If set to 1 (Yes), then by default this tooltip text will contain the name of the identifier and the current index values. You can specify your own text for each identifier in the table on the Contents tab.
