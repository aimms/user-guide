Column Area
===========

On the Column Area tab you can specify various font and color settings of the Column Area. 



**Same as Row Area** 



With this option you can make sure that the Column Area will behave and be displayed exactly the same as the Row Area. By default it is set to 'Yes'. If you set it to 'No', then you have to specify all properties for the Column Area separately from the Row Area. In other words: if 'No', none of the properties will be inherited from the Row Area.



Please note, that the **Row Area - Layout**  and **Row Area - Show First Aggregator at Parent**  option will never inherited, since they apply to the Row Area only.



**Auto-resize Column Width** 



With this option you can specify whether or not the pivot table should automatically adjust the column width (to fit the data) upon data changes. Especially for large pivot tables this may require a noticeable amount of time. You can decide to



1.	to Never automatically update the column width (default setting),

2.	update Upon manual changes only. This setting will only adjust the width of the column that was edited,

3.	update Upon all data changes. This setting will recalculate the column widths of all columns in the pivot table upon every data change (manual as well as data changes caused by a procedure run).
