Border
======

**Description** 

The border of an object consists of two parts:

*	The border style, which is either a solid line or a shadow line. The latter can make an object appear raised (out shadow) or sunken (in shadow). It is also possible to have no border. If you select a border style, you can also specify the width (thickness) of the border.
*	A margin that separates the actual object contents from the border style. The top, left, bottom and right margins can be specified individually.




**Note** 


Every newly created object initially uses the default border style. You can set this default border in the Border tab, using the small menu that appears when you press the |img_def_default_property_bmp| button. This menu contains two commands:

*	Set as default: this will set the currently specified border as the default border (that is used when a new object is created).
*	Reset to default: this will set all border properties according to the current default border.
