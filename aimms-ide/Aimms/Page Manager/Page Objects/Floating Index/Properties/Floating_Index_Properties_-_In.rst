**Description** 

The Index tab contains the properties that are unique to the Floating Index object. You can adjust the following properties here:



**Circular List** 

If you select this option, pressing the Down button while on the last element in the list will jump to the first element in the list, and vice versa for the Up button.



**Click shows List** 

If you select this option, the end-user can click on the name of the element in the Floating Index to get a dialog box with a list of all elements. This list makes it easier to select a specific element. Note that this option has no effect if the contained element parameter is not updatable or if the object is read-only.



**Up/Down buttons** 

If you select this option the up and down buttons are displayed. Note that this option has no effect if the contained element parameter is not updatable or if the object is read-only.



**Up/Down Functionality** 

With this option you can specify whether pressing the Up or Down key, selects the previous or next element in the underlying set. By default, pressing the Down button will switch to the next element in the (ordered) set, which is usually the intuitive behavior. However, if the set elements consist of increasing numbers, then it is more intuitive that pressing the Down key decreases the number shown.



**Allow Set Modification** 

This option specifies whether Add Element and Delete Element actions are allowed. If you select these settings, the Floating Index will be extended with an Add (+) and Delete (-) button. Pressing these buttons, will pop up a dialog box in which you can specify the element to be added / deleted.



**Multiple Case Object** 

If this option is checked, data for multiple cases can be made available through the Floating Index object.
