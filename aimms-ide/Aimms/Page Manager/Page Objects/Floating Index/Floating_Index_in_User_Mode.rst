User Mode
=========

**Description** 

The Floating Index is mainly used to browse through the elements of a specific set and, as a result, show different slices of identifiers in the other objects on the page. To browse through the set elements you can:

*	Click on the Up and Down buttons to go to the next or previous element,
*	Click on the name of the current element, upon which AIMMS will show a dialog box in which you can select an element, or
*	(when the object has focus) press the up or down arrow keys on the keyboard.




If the Floating Index is equipped with a plus and/or minus button at the left side of the object, then you can click on either of these buttons to add or respectively remove elements in the set.
