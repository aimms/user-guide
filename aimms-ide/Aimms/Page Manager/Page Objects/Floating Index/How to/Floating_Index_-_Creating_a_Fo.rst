Create a Forward Link
=====================

To create a forward link:

1.	While in Edit Mode, select the Floating Index and the objects you want to create a forward link to.

2.	From the Edit menu, select Link Indices - Create Links.

For each possible link found, a dialog box appears asking you to confirm the creation of the forward link.

3.	Click Link.



**Note** 

*	A forward link can only be made with an object containing a fixed element in the same set as the index in the Floating Index. Creating a fixed element in an object can be done by slicing an identifier in the identifier selection dialog box. 
*	If you select only the Floating Index object, AIMMS will search all objects on the page for possible links.
