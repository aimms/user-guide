Create a Reverse Link
=====================

To create a reverse link:

1.	While in Edit Mode, select the Floating Index object and the objects you want to create a reverse link from.

2.	From the Edit menu, select Linked Indices - Create Links.

For each possible link found, a dialog box appears asking you to confirm the creation of the reverse link.

3.	Click Link. 



**Note** 

*	A reverse link can only be made with an object containing an index over the same set as the index in the Floating Index. 
*	When you just select the Floating Index, you will get the option to make reverse links with all possible objects.
