Discrete X-Axis
===============

**Description** 

A discrete X-axis in a Gantt chart will display the elements of a set along the X-axis. This set corresponds to the range of the element parameter that is used for the Start identifier.



On the X-axis tab of the Gantt chart properties, you can specify the number of elements that should be visible. If this number is smaller the cardinality of the set, then the remaining elements can only be displayed by scrolling.
