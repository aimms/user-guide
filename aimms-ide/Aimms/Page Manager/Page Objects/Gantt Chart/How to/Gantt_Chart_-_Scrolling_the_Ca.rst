Scroll the Calendar X-Axis
==========================

**Description** 

The Calendar X-axis of a Gantt chart offers some special controls for scrolling. At the right side of each row in the calendar, there is a 'left' and a 'right' arrow. If you click on one of these arrows, the chart will scroll one time unit (corresponding to the selected calendar row) to the left or right. For example, if the row in the calendar represents days, then you can scroll one day at a time.



If you hold down the Control key, you can use these arrows also to zoom in or out on the currently visible time period.

Clicking 'Control Left' scrolls only the right side of the calendar one unit to the left (zooming in); clicking 'Control Right' scrolls only the right side of the calendar one unit to the right (zooming out). For example, if the row in the calendar represents days, then 'Ctrl-Left' decreases and 'Ctrl-Right' increases the number of days shown.
