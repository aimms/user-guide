X-axis
======

**Description** 

The Gantt chart can display three types of X-axes (the time axis)



1: A continuous range

2: A discrete range of set elements

3: A real-time calendar



When creating a Gantt chart, the type of the identifier that is used to specify the Start of a task determines whether the X-axis is continuous or discrete. If the start identifier is a numerical identifier, then the X-axis is continuous (showing numerical values), if the start identifier is an element parameter, then the X-axis is discrete (showing the elements in the set range of the element parameter).



If your time data can be translated into a real time calendar, then both these original types of X-axes can be displayed using a Calendar X-axis. In a calendar X-axis you can display various time units such as hours, days, weeks, months, years, etc., and it offers the users special control mechanisms to scroll the chart in terms of these units.
