User Mode
=========

**Description** 

In a Composite Table the user can:

*	view and edit the data,
*	sort the rows based on the values in one (or more) columns (via a simple mouse click in the column header),
*	jump to a certain row by typing the first character of a cell in a selected column,
*	adjust the width of each column,
*	re-arrange the sequence of columns, 
*	hide some of the columns, and
*	add, remove or modify a row, which corresponds to changes in the data of the domain identifier.




To modify any of the data values in the Composite Table:


1.	Select the specific cell (either by a mouse click, or by using the arrow keys).


2.	If you want to edit the current value, press F2, otherwise you can simply start typing the new value.


3.	Type the new value.


4.	Press Enter to accept the new value (or press Cancel to abort the modification)





The Composite Table can (optionally) always adjust the width of each column automatically, so that all the current values in the column fit within that width, by double clicking on the vertical line between two columns. Additionally, the user can simply resize each column by dragging the separator lines between the columns in the header of the table. In a similar way he can also drag the entire column to a new position.





**Note** 

*	You can only change the value of an identifier if the Composite Table is not read-only and if the identifier is in the set CurrentInputs, which generally means that the identifier should not have a definition.
*	The edits of the first type cannot be undone via the Edit â€“ Undo menu item.
*	It is possible to copy data from a composite table (with or without header information) to an Excel spreadsheet.
