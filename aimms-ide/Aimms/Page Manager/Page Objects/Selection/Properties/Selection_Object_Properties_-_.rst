Selection
=========

**Description** 

The selection property tab contains the selection object specific properties. 



**Text Shown** 

You can chose to make the selection from the identifier names, the identifier text or the element names.



**Radio Buttons/Check Boxes** 

You can spread the radio buttons or check boxes vertically over the area of the selection object.



Multiple Columns (list boxes only)

By default, a list box shows all items in a vertical list and a vertical scrollbar is automatically added if the number of items is too large to fit within the available height of the object. If the item names are rather small, and if the spacing on the page allows you to create a wider object, you can selection the option Multiple Columns. Then, if the number of items is too large, extra columns will appear and eventually a horizontal scrollbar is added.



Edit Field (list boxes only)

If you select this option, an edit field is added to the top (or bottom) of the list box. By entering the first characters of a specific item in the list box, you can easily locate this item in the list box. If you select this option in combination with the Add / Remove buttons, then the edit field is used to enter the item name that should be added / removed.



Add / Remove buttons (list boxes and dropdown lists only)

If the selection object shows items from a set for which it is allowed to add or remove elements, you can equip the object with two small buttons for adding and removing elements.



**First Element Equal To** 

When dealing with the specific case of a scalar identifier and set, an integer is associated with an element in the set. Default the integer associated with the first set will be one. It is possible however to give another integer to which the first element should be equal.



**Show Inactive Data** 

If this option is not selected, inactive data will be considered to have a default value. You can read more about inactive data in the Language Reference.
