Introduce Add/Remove buttons
============================

If the set that is displayed in the selection object is updatable (i.e. you are allowed to add or delete elements in it), then you can add two special buttons to the selection object that can be used to add or delete elements.

To introduce add/remove buttons in a list box or drop down list:

1.	Open the properties dialog box of the selection object.

2.	Select Add/Remove Buttons.



**Note** 

*	Add/Remove buttons can only be added to a drop down list or a list box.
*	Add/Remove buttons can only be added if the displayed set in the object is an updatable master set.
*	Add/Remove buttons can only be added in a listbox if it already contains an edit field.
*	You can add elements to the set by typing the new name and click |img_def_Selection_Add_button_bmp|. To remove an element, you can select an element from the list (or type its name), and then click |img_def_Selection_Remove_button_bmp|.
*	Instead of single elements you can also add a range of elements, for example by entering elem001 .. elem256 in the edit box and clicking the add button.
