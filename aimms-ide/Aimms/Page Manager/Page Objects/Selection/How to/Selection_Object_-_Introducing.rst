Introduce an Edit Field
=======================

If a list box is equipped with an edit field (without add/remove buttons), then you can use this field to browse through the (large) number of items in the list. The list box will try to scroll to the item that matches the characters typed in the edit field.

To introduce an edit field in a list box:

1.	Open the properties dialog box of the selection object.

2.	At Edit Field, select where you want the edit field.
