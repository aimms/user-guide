Picture Object Introduction
================================

**Description** 

With the Picture object you can add pictures to your page. The Picture object is displayed within a user defined rectangular area. If this area does not have the same size as the image itself, then you have three choices for displaying the image: using the actual image size, stretching or shrinking the image, or filling the area with multiple images.



**Note** 

*	The drawing objects on a page (rectangles, circles, lines, text and pictures) may overlap each other, and you can use the menu item Edit – Drawing Order to decide which object is 'on top'. All other objects on the page (tables, charts, etc.) will always be displayed on top of any drawing object.
*	AIMMS does not offer an editor to create or modify pictures. If you want to create or modify your pictures yourself, you should therefore use some other drawing program (e.g. Paint).
