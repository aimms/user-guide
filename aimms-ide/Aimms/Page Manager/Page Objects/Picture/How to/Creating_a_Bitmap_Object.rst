Add a Bitmap to a Page
======================

To create a picture on a page:

1.	While in Edit Mode, select Picture from the Object menu.

2.	On the page, drag a rectangle where you want the picture to appear. 

The Picture Properties dialog box appears

3.	Specify the source of the picture file.

4.	Select from Display how you want your picture displayed.

5.	Click Ok.



The picture should be available as an image file (supported files are: BMP, EMF, Exif, GIF, ICON, JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF, and WMF) which is either located on your disk or is imported as a Project User File. Besides specifying a file name directly, you can also specify the file name via a string parameter from your model.



**Tips & Tricks** 

*	If you use a string parameter that contains the file name of the picture, you can determine which picture you want to display from within your model. This enables you, for example, to show alternative pictures on your page, depending on a phase or state in your model.
