User Mode
=========

**Description** 

In user mode you can click the buttons on the parametric curve. By clicking the Start button the calculation of the y identifiers will start. You can press Pause to temporarily stop calculation, after which you can press Continue to continue calculation. By clicking the Stop button, the calculation will stop and can not be continued.



**Note** 

*	If the Parametric Curve has finished all calculation for the current range, then the X-axis identifier is reset to the value it had before the parametric run, and one extra run is made using this value.
*	If you press Pause, then all other objects will be refreshed with the last calculated values (corresponding to the last value of the X-axis identifier).
*	If a Parametric Curve is paused, you cannot close the page. You should first let the curve continue its calculations, or you should press the Stop button.
