Range/Step
==========

**Description** 

Here you can specify how the x identifier should be varied.

*	Start - the first value of the x -identifier.
*	Stop - the last value of the x-identifier.
*	Nr. of Steps - The number of steps between start and stop. This can be either a number or a numerical parameter.
*	Procedure to Run - The procedure that is run with every step to calculate the y identifiers. 




**Note** 

*	Often the procedure involves solving a model. In that case the parametric curve can be used to display what the influence on the solution of a model is when one of the constraints is relaxed.




**Tips & Tricks** 

*	If you use identifiers for both the Start and Stop entries, and present these identifiers elsewhere on the same page, you can let the user specify its own parametric range.
