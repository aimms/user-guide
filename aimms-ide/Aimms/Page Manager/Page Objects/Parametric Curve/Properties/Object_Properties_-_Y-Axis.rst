Y-Axis
======

**Description** 

On the Y-Axis property tab, you can specify the numerical range to be displayed along the Y-axis of a chart. By default, AIMMS determines the lower and upper bound of the range itself, but you can also specify the bounds yourself. These bounds can be specified either by fixed values or via identifiers from the model.

Besides the lower and upper bounds, you can also specify the number of grid points to be displayed.

If your chart contains multiple identifiers, with values not in the same order of magnitude, you can specify scaling values to be applied to (some of) the identifiers. These scaling values can either be fixed numbers or identifiers from the model.
