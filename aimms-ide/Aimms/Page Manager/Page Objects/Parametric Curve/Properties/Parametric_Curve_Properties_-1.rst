**Description** 

On the Contents tab of the Parametric Curve you can modify the X-axis and/or Y-axis identifier. If the Y-axis identifier is a scalar then you can also add or delete Y-axis identifiers. Additionally, you can add scalar identifiers that will be used to draw straight horizontal or vertical lines in the chart (e.g. to indicate critical bounds). When adding an identifier you should first select the proper position in the presented list, so that it is clear whether you intend to add an Y-axis identifier, a horizontal line or a vertical line.



**Note** 

*	You can also add identifiers to a parametric curve by switching the page to edit mode and selecting and dragging multiple identifiers from the model tree into the parametric curve.




**Tips & Tricks** 

*	If you add a vertical line using the same scalar identifier as the one for the X-axis, then this line will indicate the current X step during the parametric run.
