Introduction
============

**Description** 

The navigation object is a special object to help the end user in navigating through the pages of your application. The navigation object is built upon the page hierarchy that is created in the Page Manager tool. In the object the child pages and/or ancestor pages of a given reference page are presented either via buttons, text, or a part of the navigation tree. The end-user can open any of the presented pages by clicking on the specific entry.

Furthermore an action can be executed upon navigating to a page through the object. These actions are mostly equivalent to the actions that are available through the button object. 

The navigation object can also be used as a display only object, this is particular useful for displaying the page title of your page.



**Note** 

*	If the current page is displayed in a page object, this page will be displayed in the selection color (as specified on the Color tab of the properties dialog box.
*	Changes in the Page Manager tree are not directly propagated in the navigation object if it is currently displayed on the screen. You can update manually via open and close of the property dialog box.
