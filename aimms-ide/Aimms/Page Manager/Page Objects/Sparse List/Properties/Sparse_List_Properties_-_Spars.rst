Sparse List
===========

**Description** 

On the Sparse List property tab you can change the basic appearance of a Sparse List.



**Layout** 

With this property you can specify the lay out. The lay out can be values only, text/labels and values, values and text/labels or text/labels only. When both text/labels and values are shown it can be useful to change the separator sign. The default separator sign is '=', it can be any character or no character.



**Header** 

In the header of a sparse list you can have the name of the (first) identifier that you display. You can also show the symbolic name of the free indices above each label column.



**Show Inactive Data** 

If this option is not selected, inactive data will be considered to have a default value. In a Sparse List this means that the inactive elements are not listed. You can read more about inactive data in the Language Reference.
