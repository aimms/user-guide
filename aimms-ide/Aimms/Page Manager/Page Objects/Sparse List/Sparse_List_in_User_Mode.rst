User Mode
=========

**Description** 

A Sparse List shows all non-default values of a particular identifier(slice). In user mode you can make changes to these values by selecting the value and typing a new value. If you change a value into the default value of the identifier, then the element is automatically removed from the list.



**Note** 

*	You can only change the value of an identifier if the Sparse List is not read-only and if the identifier is in the set CurrentInputs, which generally means that the identifier should not have a definition.
