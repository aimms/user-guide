Selecting Objects on a Page
===========================

**Description** 

There are several ways to select objects on a page.



**Using the mouse** 

If you select objects using the mouse you should first make sure that you are in select mode, by selecting |img_def_Select_button_bmp| Select from the Object menu. You can then select a single object by clicking on it. If you want to select more than one object, you can hold down the shift key and click on the objects you want to select as well. Alternatively, you can select objects by dragging a rectangle (while holding down the left-mouse button), so that every object that is completely within this rectangle will be selected.



**Using the keyboard** 

By consecutively pressing the Tab key you can select each single object on the page. Which object is selected next is determined by the 'drawing order' imposed on the objects.



**Selecting all objects at once** 

If you select Select All from the Edit menu, AIMMS will select all objects on the page.



**Note** 

*	A currently selected object is marked by little black rectangles at the corners of the object.
*	You can only select the objects that are part of the page itself. Inherited objects from templates cannot be selected.
