Document Viewer Introduction
================================

**Description** 

With the document viewer ActiveX object, you can display various types of documents embedded on an AIMMS page. All registered file types can be displayed, but keep in mind that the document viewer object is a simple browser. So, while displaying a web page does exactly what you expect, trying to display an AIMMS .prj-file would result in a dialog appearing, asking you whether you want to download the selected file. As a rule of thumb, all file types that can be displayed in Internet Explorer, can be displayed with the document viewer object.
