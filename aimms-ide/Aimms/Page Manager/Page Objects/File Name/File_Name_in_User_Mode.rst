User Mode
=========

**Description** 

In user mode you can select a new file. The name of the file will be contained in the string parameter that is linked to the file name object.



**Note** 

*	You can only change the file name if the File Nname object is not read-only and if the string parameter is in the set CurrentInputs, which generally means that the identifier should not have a definition.
