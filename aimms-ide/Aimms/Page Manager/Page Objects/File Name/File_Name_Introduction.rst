Introduction
============

**Description** 

The File Name object offers a way to let the user pick a specific (new) filename. In this fashion you can let a user of your application interactively decide what files should be used for reading and/or writing. In the File Name object the user can directly type the required file name, but it also offers a button which will bring up a standard file selection dialog box, in which the user can browse through the directories and select a file. The File Name object uses a string parameter to store the selected name.



**Note** 

*	The file selection dialog box can also be opened by calling the FileSelect or FileSelectNew procedures.
