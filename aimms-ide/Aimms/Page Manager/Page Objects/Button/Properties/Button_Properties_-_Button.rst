Button
======

**Description** 

On the Button tab of the properties dialog box you can specify how the button should be displayed on the page. You can choose between three styles:



**Text Button** 

The button is shown with a text face. The specific text can be given as a static string, or via a string parameter.



**Bitmap Button** 

The button is shown with a bitmap face. The specific bitmap file is given as a static file name, or via a string parameter. You can select a file name that is located on your disk, or (preferably) a Project User File which is part of your project.



**Invisible Button** 

If the page is in User Mode, the button will not be displayed as such. Instead, the area where it is located becomes 'clickable'. You can specify a title for an invisible button, but this title is only visible if the button is shown on a page that is in Edit Mode.



**Draw Flat Transparent button** 

The text and bitmap button can be drawn in flat transparent style, i.e. without a visible border.



**Tooltip** 

You can specify a tooltip for the button by means of a static string, or a string parameter.
