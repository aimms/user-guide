Performing Assertion Checks
===========================

To provide you with a mechanism to implement data validity checks, AIMMS offers a special Assertion data type. With it, you can easily specify and verify logical conditions for elements in a particular domain, and take appropriate action when you find an inconsistency.

To add a button action that verifies a (number of) assertions:

1.	While in Edit Mode open the Properties dialog box of the Object you wish to assign the action to.

2.	Change to the Action tab.

3.	Select the Assertion Check action from the Select Action to Add list.

The Assertion Check dialog box appears on the right hand side of the tab

4.	Select Add from the Assertion Check dialog box.

The Identifier Selection wizard appears.

5.	Select which assertion you want to add.

6.	Click Finish.

7.	Repeat steps 5 through 6, for all assertions you want to add.

8.	Click Ok.
