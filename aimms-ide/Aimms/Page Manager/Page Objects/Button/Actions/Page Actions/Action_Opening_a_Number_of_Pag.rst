Opening a Number of Pages
=========================

To add an action to your object that opens a number of pages:

1.	While in Edit Mode, open the Properties dialog box of the Object you wish to assign the action to.

2.	Change to the Action tab.

3.	Select the Linked Page(s) action from the Select Action to Add list.

The Linked Page(s) dialog box appears on the right hand side of the tab

4.	Add the pages you want to open to your Linked Page(s) action.

5.	Select Automatic Open, User Selects or Selection via Identifier.

6.	When Selection via Identifier, type an identifier name or use the Identifier selection dialog box.

7.	Click Ok.



**Remark** 

When you have chosen Selection via Identifier, the page that will be opened depends on the order of the pages in the Linked Page(s) action. If the identifier value is equal to 1, the first page in the list will be opened. If it is 2, the second in the list will be opened, and so on. AIMMS will generate an error message if the parameter does not hold a correct value upon execution of the action.
