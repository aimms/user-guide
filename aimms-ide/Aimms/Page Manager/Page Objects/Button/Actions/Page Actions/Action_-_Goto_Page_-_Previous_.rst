Goto Page - Previous Page
=========================

To add an action that opens the previous page in the page tree:

1.	While in Edit Mode, open the Properties dialog box of the Object you wish to assign the action to.

2.	Change to the Action tab.

3.	Select the Goto Page action from the Select Action to Add list and click Add. 

The Goto Page window appears on the right hand side of the tab

4.	Select Previous Page in the selection box.

5.	Select what you want to happen if there is no previous page. You can choose to 'Go Nowhere', 'Use a cyclic sequence', or 'Go to parent page'.

6.	Select whether you want to 'Ignore parent boundaries'. If you select this setting the page above the current page will be considered the previous page, ignoring separators or the possibility that the page has a different parent page.

7.	Select whether you want to 'Combine with following go to page action'. If you select this and there is a following page action, AIMMS will combine the two and will use the result of this go to page action as the reference page for the next go to page action, without actually opening this page.

8.	Click Ok.
