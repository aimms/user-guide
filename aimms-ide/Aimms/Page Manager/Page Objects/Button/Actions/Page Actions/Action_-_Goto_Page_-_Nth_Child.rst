Goto Page - Nth Child
=====================

To add an action that opens the Nth child page in the page tree:

1.	While in Edit Mode, open the Properties dialog box of the Object you wish to assign the action to.

2.	Change to the Action tab.

3.	Select the Goto Page action from the Select Action to Add list and click Add.

The Goto Page window appears on the right hand side of the tab
