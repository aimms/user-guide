Goto Page - Parent Page
=======================

To add an action that opens the parent page in the page tree:

1.	While in Edit Mode, open the Properties dialog box of the Object you wish to assign the action to.

2.	Change to the Action tab.

3.	Select the Goto Page action from the Select Action to Add list and click Add.

The Goto Page window appears on the right hand side of the tab

4.	Select Parent Page in the selection box.

5.	Select whether you want to 'Combine with following go to page action'. If you select this and there is a following page action, AIMMS will combine the two and will use the result of this go to page action as the reference page for the next go to page action, without actually opening this page.

6.	Click Ok.
