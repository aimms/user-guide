Create a Bitmap Button
======================

To create a bitmap button on a page:

1.	While in Edit Mode, select Button |img_def_Button_button_bmp| from the Object Menu.

2.	On the page, drag a rectangle where you want the button to appear.

The Button Properties dialog box appears.

3.	Select Bitmap Button.

4.	Give the source name of the bitmap, either by typing the file name, or specifying a string parameter. Alternatively you can use a wizard to perform either of these tasks.

5.	Click Ok.



**Tips & Tricks** 

Instead of referring to a bitmap file name on disk, you can refer to a Project User File, which is stored as part of the project file. The advantages of these files are that:

*	they cannot be accidentally be modified or removed by the end-user, and
*	you do not have to copy separate bitmap files when copying your project to another location.

The dialog box for the Project User Files is accessible via the wizard button for selecting the bitmap file name.
