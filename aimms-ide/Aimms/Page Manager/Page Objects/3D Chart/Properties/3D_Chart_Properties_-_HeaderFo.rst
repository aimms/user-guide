Header/Footer
=============

**Description** 

The "Header/Footer"-tab contains all properties necessary to specify the header and/or the footer of the chart.



**Header** 

This property specifies what text will be shown in the header of the chart. Only if a text is entered here, the rest of the header-related properties are displayed.



**Font** 

The font that is used to display the header.



**Horizontal alignment** 

This property specifies where exactly the header is displayed above the chart. It can take the values of "Left", "Right" and "Center". "Center" is the default value. The horizontal alignment is relative to the chart area, not to the surrounding area. For example, if you have a legend displayed to the right of the chart area and you've specified "Right" as the horizontal alignment of the header, the header text is still completely displayed above the chart area and not aligned to the right of the chart object itself.



**Foreground color** 

The foreground color of the text in the header.



**Background color** 

The background color of the text in the header.



**Background image** 

The filename of the image that should serve as a background in the header area of the chart. The sub-properties are the same as the usual image properties.

**Border type/width** 

See: chart area border type and width on the :ref:`2D-Chart_2D_Chart_Properties_-_Display`  





**Footer** 

The footer has exactly the same properties as the header, so for further information, see 'Header' above.
