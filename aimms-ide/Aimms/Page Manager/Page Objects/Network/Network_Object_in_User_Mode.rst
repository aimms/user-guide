User Mode
=========

**Description** 

In user mode you can make changes to the layout of a network by dragging the nodes to other positions.



If the developer has enabled the zoom functionality of the network object, you can zoom-in and zoom-out on the displayed area of the network via the buttons next to the scrollbars at the right and/or bottom of the object. Additionally, you can also zoom in on a particular area of the network by dragging a rectangle around an area and select Zoom Selected area from the popup menu that appears after you have released the mouse button.



**Note** 

*	If the identifiers that contain the X and Y coordinates of each node are not updatable, then the nodes cannot be moved via a drag operation.
