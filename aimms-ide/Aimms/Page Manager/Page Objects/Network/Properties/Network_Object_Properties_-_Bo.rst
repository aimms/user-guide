Bounds
======

**Description** 

In the Bounds tab of the Network Object Properties dialog box, you can specify limits on the total area that you can reacht via scrolling and zooming, and the minimum size of a zoomed area.



**Total Area** 

The four bounds that you specify here are limits on how far you can scroll into one direction and how far you can zoom-out.

*	Left, Right, Top, Bottom. These four fields can contain either values or identifiers. If they contain values, the values are used to specify the maximal coordinates beyond which scrolling is not allowed. If the fields contain identifiers, the maximal coordinates can be adjusted by adjusting the values of these identifiers.




**Minimal Zoomed Area** 


The sizes that you specify here determine how far you can zoom-in.

*	Width. The value or identifier here specifies the minimum distance between the left and the right of the zoom area.
*	Height. The value or identifier here specifies the minimum distance between the top and the bottom of the zoom area.
