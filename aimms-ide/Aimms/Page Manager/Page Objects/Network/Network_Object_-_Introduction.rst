Network Introduction
======================

**Description** 

The network object allows you to visualize a network of nodes and arcs. Nodes and arcs are drawn in a 2 dimensional graph in which you can interactively manipulate the location of the nodes. The object has an optional zoom feature, which can be used to inspect regions in the network flow. Furthermore nodes and arcs can be drawn in various ways.



A node in the Network object corresponds to an element in a set and its position in the graph must be given via 2 parameters representing the X and Y coordinates. You can display multiple sets of nodes.



An arc in the Network object is represented via a 2-dimensional identifier indexed over two of the sets that are used as nodes. An arc is drawn between two nodes if the corresponding element in the arc-identifier exists.



The Network object can draw its nodes and arcs on top of a background picture (for example an area map). This background picture should be provided as a bitmap file.
