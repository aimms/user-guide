**Description** 

For each data object you can specify whether a popup menu should appear when the user clicks the right-mouse button in the object. The right-mouse popup menu can either be selected explicitly for the object, or you can choose to use the right-mouse popup menu that is defined for the page itself.

You can create your own right-mouse popup menus in the Menu Builder.
