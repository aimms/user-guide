**Description** 

On the contents tab of a table it is possible to add, modify and remove identifiers. You can also change the order of identifiers in the table.



**Note** 

*	If multiple more dimensional identifiers are combined in a single table, AIMMS will try to match the indices with the indices already present in the rows and columns. You can influence this mechanism to some extend by placing the indices in the added identifiers in the most suitable order.
*	For the Table Object, the Identifier Selection dialog box offers extra features to define the ordering of the indices. Within this ordering you can also specify a split between the indices that should appear as rows and the indices that should appear as columns in the table.
*	You can also add identifiers to a table by switching the page to edit mode and selecting and dragging multiple identifiers from the model tree into the table.
