**Description** 

The Table Property tab contains the table specific properties. 



**Remove Defaults** 

You have the possibility to remove all entries from the table that have a default value.

With this option you can indicate whether set elements for which only default values exist, should be displayed in the table. You can use it to effectively reduce the size of a table when there are several of such elements. 



**Row Indentation** 

When you have more than one index on the rows of the table, you can activate row indentation. If row indentation is switched off, elements will be displayed next to each other. If row indentation is switched on, elements will be displayed below each other, using indentation. 



**Multiple Cell Changes** 

You have the possibility to apply the changes that are made to a single cell to all cells in the currently selected block. If you do not select this option, the user can only edit one value at a time. 



**Multiple Case Object** 

If you choose the multiple case object option, the data from different cases will be shown in the table. 



**Show Inactive Data** 

If this option is not selected, inactive data will be considered to have a default value. You can read more about inactive data in the Language Reference.



**Allow Multiple Lines in Column Headers** 

If you select this option, a text in any of the column labels will be split over multiple lines if the width of the specific column (set with the option Max Column Width) is too small (instead of being cut-off). Alternatively you can use a string parameter as title (on the Text tab) containing new line (\n) codes to specify how you want a column title to be cut off.



**Show All Horizontal Grid Lines** 

If you select this option horizontal grid lines will be shown in the table.



**Show All Vertical Grid Lines** 

If you select this option vertical grid lines will be shown in the table.



**Max Column Width** 

By default the width of each column is derived from the format that is used for the cell entries (see the Format tab), and the length of the text in the column header. If this latter text is too large, then you can set a maximum width via this option. The given width is measured in units of an average character width in the currently selected font.



**Max Row Label Width** 

By default the layout of the table will be such that the all row titles are completely visible. With this option you can limit the width that is used for a row title. The given width is measured in units of an average character width in the currently selected font.



**Status Line** 

This options controls whether or not a status line is displayed. The status line is an area at the bottom of the object in which the description of the currently selected element is shown. If displayed, you can specify how many lines you want to reserve for the status lines (1, 2 or 3). The Include Value checkbox specifies whether the value of the selected element should be displayed in the statusbar as well.
