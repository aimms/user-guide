Rectangle
=========

**Description:** 

The Rectangle property tab contains the specific properties that are available for the rectangle object. You can adjust the following properties here:



**Type** 

This selects the type of rectangle that is shown on the page. You can choose between a transparent rectangle (only showing the outer line), a solid rectangle, or a rectangle that appears to be sunken or raised.



**Style** 

This selects the border style of the rectangle.



**Line Width** 

This value defines the width of the border of the rectangle. 



**Note** 

*	If you select the 'sunken' or 'raised' rectangle type, then the colors that are used for the light and dark shadow effects are derived from the background color as specified on the Color tab. The specified foreground color is ignored for this type.
