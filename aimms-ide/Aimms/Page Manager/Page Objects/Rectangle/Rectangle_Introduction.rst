Introduction
============

**Description** 

A Rectangle is a simple drawing object that you can use to create the background picture of your page. With this object you can create any rectangular shape, either with a solid colored interior or with a transparent interior (only showing the outline), and with various border styles.



**Note** 

*	The drawing objects on a page (rectangles, circles, lines, text and pictures) may overlap each other, and you can use the menu item Edit – Drawing Order to decide which object is 'on top'. All other objects on the page (tables, charts, etc.) will always be displayed on top of any drawing object.
