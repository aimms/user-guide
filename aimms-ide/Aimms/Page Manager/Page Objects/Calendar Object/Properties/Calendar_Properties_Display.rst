**Description** 

On this tab, all properties that control the look of the calendar are located.





**Show 'today'** 

Setting this property to 1 (the default) will display a text line at the bottom of the calendar, indicating the current date (not the date currently selected). Setting this property to 0 will not display this text line.



**Show 'today' circle** 

Setting this property to 1 (the default) will put a red circle around the current date. Setting this property to 0 will not display this red circle.



**Show week numbers** 

Setting this property to 1 will show the week numbers to the left of the calendar and a vertical line to separate the week numbers from the rest of the calendar. Setting this property to 0 (the default) will not show the week numbers.



**First day of week** 

This property specifies which day should be the leftmost day to display above the calendar. Clearly, this also influences the positions of the individual dates. The default value is "Sunday".



**Scroll rate** 

This property specifies how many months back or ahead will be scrolled when clicking on the arrow buttons in the title area. The default value is 1, which results in the previous or the next month to be displayed when clicking on the left or the right arrow button respectively. Should you set this property to 2, for example, then "October 2003" will be displayed after clicking on the right arrow button, if the month currently displayed is "August 2003".
