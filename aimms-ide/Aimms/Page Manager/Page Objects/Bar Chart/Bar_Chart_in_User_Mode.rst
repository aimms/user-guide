User Mode
=========

**Description** 

In user mode you can select a bar in the bar chart and change the value of the identifier that is represented by the bar by dragging the top of the bar up or down, or by entering a new value in the status line.



**Note** 

*	You can only change the value of an identifier if the bar chart is not read-only and if the identifier is in the set CurrentInputs, which generally means that the identifier should not have a definition.
