**Description** 

In the Contents tab of the Bar Chart properties dialog box, you can add, remove and modify the identifiers that are displayed in the chart. If you specify multiple identifiers, then these identifiers should either be all scalar, or all one-dimensional (with the same domain index).

Besides the identifiers that are displayed as the bars in the bar chart, you can also add scalar identifiers that will be displayed as horizontal lines in the chart (for example, to indicate critical bounds for the bars).

When adding identifiers to the bar chart you should first select the proper position in the current list of identifiers, so that it is clear what type of identifier you want to add. When you want to add a horizontal line, you should select the horizontal lines line or one of the horizontal lines before clicking the Add button. If you want to add bars to the chart, you need to select one of the bars.



**Note** 

*	You can also add identifiers to a bar chart by switching the page to edit mode and selecting and dragging multiple identifiers from the model tree into the bar chart.
