**Description** 

Lines can be used to draw the background picture of your page. Lines can be stretched, moved and rotated further after they have been created. Furthermore, lines can be used to draw arrows and can have various styles and colors. 



**Note** 

*	The drawing objects on a page (rectangles, circles, lines, text and pictures) may overlap each other, and you can use the menu item Edit – Drawing Order to decide which object is 'on top'. All other objects on the page (tables, charts, etc.) will always be displayed on top of any drawing object.
