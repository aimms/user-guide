Tabbed Pages
============

**Description** 

In the tabbed pages tab, you can adjust the following properties:



**Show Children of** 

You can specify to show the children of This Page, the page on which the tabbed page object is placed, or you can select Other Page and use the wizard to select another page. All child pages of the selected page are shown in the tabbed page object.



**Tab Bar Position** 

The tabs that can be used to show the different pages in the tabbed page object cab be shown at the Top or Bottom of the object. Alternatively you can also use a tabbed page object without tabs, in which case the Tab Bar Position should be set to Hidden Tabs. Using a tabbed page object without tabs can be useful when in a certain area of a page you want to show different page objects depending on certain settings. You can introduce two (or more) overlapping tabbed page objects that show different single pages, so that only one of these tabbed page objects is shown at the same time using the object's visibility settings. This is a good alternative for placing all objects on one page overlapping each other, as it is easier to develop and you also have more freedom with respect to resizability. 



**Multiple Tab Rows** 

By checking the Multiple Tab Rows setting the tabbed page object will divide the tabs over multiple lines if necessary.



**Currently Selected Page** 

With the wizard you can select a scalar string parameter that will contain the name of page corresponding to the selected tab.
