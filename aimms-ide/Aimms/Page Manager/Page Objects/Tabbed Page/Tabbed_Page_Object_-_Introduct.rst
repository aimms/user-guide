Introduction
============

**Description** 

The tabbed page object is a special object to help the end user in navigating through the pages of your application. The tabbed page object is built upon the page hierarchy that is created in the Page Manager tool. In the object the child pages of a given reference page are presented via tabs. The end-user can open any of the presented pages by clicking on the corresponding tab.



**Note** 

*	Changes in the Page Manager tree are not directly propagated in the navigation object if it is currently displayed on the screen. You can update manually via open and close of the property dialog box.
*	By specifying resizability lines on the pages that are shown in the tabbed page object, you can make sure that the pages are resized to fit into the tabbed pages frame.
