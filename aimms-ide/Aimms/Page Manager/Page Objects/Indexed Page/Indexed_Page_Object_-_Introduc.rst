Introduction
============

**Description** 

The indexed page object can be used to show the same page for several items in a set. The page that is shown can be dependent on an element parameter. In the indexed page object that page can be shown for all elements in the range of the element parameter. 



**Note** 

*	Changes in the shown page are not directly propagated in the indexed page object if it is currently displayed on the screen. You can update manually via open and close of the page on which the indexed page object is located.
*	By specifying resizability lines on the page that is shown in the indexed page object, you can make sure that the pages are resized to fit into the indexed page frame.
