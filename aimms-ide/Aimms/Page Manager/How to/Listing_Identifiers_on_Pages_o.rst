List Identifiers that are Used on Pages
=======================================

To find out which identifiers are used on a certain page or template.

1.	Select the page(s) or template(s) in the Page Manager or the Template Manager.

2.	From the Edit menu, select the Used Identifiers command.



A listbox will appear showing the identifiers that are used on the selected page (not including identifiers that appear in page objects that are inherited from a template page) or template. To inspect whether some used identifiers are actually private (and not accessible) on a specific location, an extra column is available that shows the 'Accessible' status: either 'Yes',  'Yes (private)' or 'No'. If 'No' the entry is also displayed in red, since this is regarded as an error. The dialog contains a 'Show Where...' button. When pressing it, the page or template will highlight all items that use the currently selected identifiers.
