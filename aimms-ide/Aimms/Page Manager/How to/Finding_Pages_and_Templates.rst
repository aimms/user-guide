Finding Pages and Templates
===========================

To find the set of pages and/or templates that contain page objects depending on some specified AIMMS identifiers:

1.	Select the identifiers in the Model Tree, the Identifier Selector or a View Window.

2.	Drag the selection of identifiers to the Page Manager or Template Manager



AIMMS will now select all pages and templates that contain at least one of the identifiers from the selection that has been dragged to the Page Manager or Template Manager.



**Note** 

*	When dragging identifiers from a View Window to the Page Manager or Template Manager, you should start dragging from the identifier icon column (the first column) in the View Window.
