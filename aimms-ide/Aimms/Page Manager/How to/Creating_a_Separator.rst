Create a Separator
==================

A Page Separator is used to separate a list of child pages in two groups (both having the same parent page). Within such a group, the next or previous page is limited to members of that same group (so the cyclic next and previous reference will not cross a page separator).



To create a page separator:

1.	Open the Page Manager.

2.	Select an existing node in the Page Tree below which you want to insert the page separator.

3.	From the Edit menu, select New â€“ Separator.
