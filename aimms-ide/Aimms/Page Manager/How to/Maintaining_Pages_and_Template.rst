Maintaining Pages
=================

**Description** 

Since most of the pages/templates that are developed with a project contain model identifiers, changes made to the model may affect the pages/templates. To make the developer aware of these changes, AIMMS will mark the pages/templates that are changed as out-of-date. When opening a page or template AIMMS will automatically check for identifiers that do no longer exist in the model. At such a point AIMMS will prompt you with a dialog box that allows you to replace the identifier on the page with an existing model identifier (without explicitly having to edit the page). 



To identify the effects of model changes in more detail AIMMS offers facilities to list all identifiers that are used within a certain page/template. On the other hand, AIMMS can also identify all pages/templates that depend upon a certain selection of model identifiers.
