Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete Page Objects
========================================

**Description** 

On a page in edit mode you can cut, copy, paste and delete page objects using the menu functions in the Edit menu. These operations work on objects in a similar way as they would work on text. 



**Note** 

*	Although there is no undo option for any modification that you make to a page object, you can, as long as you have not saved your changes, close the page without saving, to get the original page layout back.
*	Instead of copying the same page objects on different pages, it is often better to use templates. This improves the maintainability of your project.
*	AIMMS does allow you to copy and paste page objects on top of each other. However, this is not recommended if you intend to show both objects at the same time, because it leads to an inconsistent and rather strange behavior. Only if you use the visibility properties of an object to alternatively show only one of the overlapping objects, then it may make sense to create overlapping objects.
