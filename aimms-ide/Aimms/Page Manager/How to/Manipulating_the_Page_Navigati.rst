Manipulate the Page Navigation Tree
===================================

**Description** 

In the Page Manager you can perform various operations on your current tree of pages. Similarly to the other trees in AIMMS, you can create new pages anywhere in the tree, delete pages, rename pages, copy or move pages to another position etc. In addition to these common management operations, you can also use the Page Tree to quickly open a specific page (in user mode), by simply double-clicking on the page.

When starting with a new project the Page Tree contains a single page root node |img_def_Root_Node_Page_Manager_bmp|. This root node is only used for structuring purposes and is not a page of itself. All pages that you create will appear as descendants of this root node.
