Hidden Templates
================

**Description** 

Via the properties of a template, you can make a template (temporarily) hidden. If a template is hidden, it will be ignored during the construction of pages that depend on it.



**Tips & Tricks** 

*	If you specify the hidden state via a model identifier, whose value is calculated based upon the current user or authorization level, you can create templates (containing objects) that are only visible on the page for some authorized users.
