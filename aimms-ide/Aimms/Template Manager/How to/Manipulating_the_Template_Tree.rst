Manipulate the Template Tree
============================

**Description** 

In the Template Manager you can perform various operations on your current tree of templates and pages. Similarly to the other trees in AIMMS, you can create new templates anywhere in the tree, delete templates, rename templates, copy or move templates to another position etc. Most of these operations apply to both end-user pages and templates, except for the creation and deletion. End-user pages can only be created and deleted in the Page Manager, while templates can only be created and deleted in the Template Manager.

In addition to the operations mentioned above, in the Template Manager you can:

*	create duplicates of existing templates,
*	double-click on a page or template to open it in edit mode.

When starting a new project, the Template Tree contains a single root node |img_def_Root_Node_Template_Manager_bmp|. This root node is only used for structuring purposes and is not a template of itself. All templates and pages will appear as descendants of this root node.
