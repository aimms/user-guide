Cut, Copy and Paste in the Page Manager
=======================================

**Description** 

Cut, Copy and Paste actions in the Page and Template Manager behave like Cut, Copy and Paste actions in general AIMMS trees with the following exception.



In most AIMMS trees, intermediate nodes are used for structural purposes only. In the Page /Template Tree however, intermediate nodes are pages/templates themselves, and thus it makes sense to copy only the intermediate node without its descendants. If you select an intermediate page node and select the Copy command, AIMMS will ask whether you want to copy only the single intermediate page node or the page node and all its descendants.
