Duplicate a Template
====================

**Description** 

Because the Template Manager uses a tree structure to define relations between templates and pages, you cannot freely choose the individual templates from which you want to construct your page. Since, if you position a page as child of a specific template, then you automatically inherit the parent templates of this template as well.

If you want to use a specific template, but not its parent templates, then you can create a duplicate of this template, and move this template at another position in the tree.

Thus, duplicates allow you to construct your pages from any combination of individual templates, without loosing the advantage of creating consistent pages that have the same look and feel.
