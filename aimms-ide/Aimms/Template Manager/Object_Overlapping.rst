Object Overlapping
==================

**Description** 

When using templates, it is quite easy to create a situation in which the objects on the final page are overlapping. When this occurs, AIMMS does not generate warnings for it. Even so, it is recommended not to have overlapping data objects on a page, unless you make sure that only of these objects is visible.



**Tips & Tricks** 

*	Object overlapping can be useful in combination with hidden objects. You could place two objects on the same position upon a page of which only one (depending on a model identifier) is visible at a time.
