If Help file not available
==========================

If you are linked to a non-existing Solver topic, then the Solver Help file to which you should be directed, is not available. Normally this is because the specific solver has not been installed during the installation of AIMMS. If you need this solver/help file, you can run the Complete installation of AIMMS instead of the Typical installation. 



Note that the Help is also available in PDF format, in which all solver files are included. You can find this AIMMS_help.pdf file in the Doc directory of your AIMMS installation (e.g. C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\AIMMS\IFA\Aimms\4.xx.x.xxx-x64\Doc).
