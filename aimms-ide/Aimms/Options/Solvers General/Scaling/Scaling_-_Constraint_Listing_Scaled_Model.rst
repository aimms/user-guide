Constraint Listing Scaled Model
===============================



Type:	Selection	

Range:	The settings listed below	

Default:	Off	



This option controls whether AIMMS should use the scaled model and solution if the constraint listing is produced. Possible values are:



*	Off
*	On




If this option is switched on and if the option **Scale Model**  has been switched on, then the scaled model and solution will be used to print the constraint listing, otherwise the original (unscaled) model and solution will be used. The option **Constraint Listing**  should be activated to produce the constraint listing.
