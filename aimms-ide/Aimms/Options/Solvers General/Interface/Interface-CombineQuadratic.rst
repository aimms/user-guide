.. _Options_Interface-CombineQuadratic:


Combine Quadratic Terms
=======================



Type:	Selection	

Range:	The settings listed below	

Default:	Automatic	



When this option is turned on, quadratic terms in constraint definitions will be combined by the AIMMS translator before passing the constraints to the solver. For instance, if the definition of some constraint contains the quadratic term x * z + y * z then this will be passed as (z + y) * x if this option is turned on, and as x * z + y * z if this option is turned off.



In general, the solvers CONOPT, IPOPT, KNITRO, MINOS and SNOPT are more efficient if this option is turned on, and the solver BARON is more efficient if this option is turned off. This option has no influence on the performance of linear solvers (CBC, COPT, CPLEX, Gurobi).



With the default setting ("Automatic") AIMMS tries to automatically determine whether it is best to combine quadratic terms or not.



This option becomes effective when a mathematical program is generated by AIMMS.



Possible values are:



*	Off
*	On
*	Automatic
