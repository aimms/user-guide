Preprocess Uncertain Model
==========================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	On	



If this option is switched on then AIMMS will try to preprocess the uncertain mathematical programming by, e.g., changing fixed uncertain parameters into normal parameters and removing doubletons. As a result the robust counterpart will become smaller and often easier to solve.



Possible values are:



    *	On
    *	Off
