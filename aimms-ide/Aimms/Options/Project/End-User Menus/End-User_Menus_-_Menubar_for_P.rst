Menubar for Project Window
==========================



**Type**:	Name of a menubar	

**Range**:	AIMMS menubar	

**Default**:	-	



With this option you can specify an alternative menubar for the project window. In AIMMS versions prior to 3.13, the project window could optionally made visible. In AIMMS 3.13 and later versions, the project window does no longer exist as such. However, when all tool windows and pages are closed and you are left with an empty main AIMMS window, then the menu that is defined for the project window will be shown.



**Note** 

*	This menubar will only be used in the end-user version of AIMMS.
