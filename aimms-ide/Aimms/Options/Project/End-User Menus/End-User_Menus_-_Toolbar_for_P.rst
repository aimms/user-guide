Toolbar for Project Window
==========================



:Type:	Name of a toolbar	
:Range:	AIMMS toolbar	
:Default:	\-	



With this option you can specify an alternative toolbar for the project window. In AIMMS versions prior to 3.13, the project window could optionally made visible. In AIMMS 3.13 and later versions, the project window does no longer exist as such. However, when all tool windows and pages are closed and you are left with an empty main AIMMS window, then the toolbar that is defined for the project window will be shown.





**Note** 

*	This toolbar will only be used in the end-user version of AIMMS.
*	When you don't specify a menubar for the project window, no toolbar will be displayed.
*	When you do specify a menubar, but no toolbar, no toolbar will be displayed.
