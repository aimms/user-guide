Save New Data Pages
===================

:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Upon confirmation



AIMMS automatically generates data pages for identifiers for which you want to show the Data from within the Model Explorer.

If you make manual changes to the content of such a data page, the page needs to be stored in the Page Manager tree for later references. To prevent the Page Manager from becoming to cluttered with these modified data pages, with this option you can indicate whether or not you want to confirm that such a new data page is created in the Page Manager.



Possible values are:



    *	Never
    *	Upon confirmation
