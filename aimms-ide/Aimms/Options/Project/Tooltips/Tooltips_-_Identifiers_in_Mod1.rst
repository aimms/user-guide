Identifiers in Model Text
=========================



Type:	Selection	

Range:	The settings listed below	

Default:	Only During Debugging/Profiling	



In the Attribute Forms of the model editor, you can get tooltip information when hovering over identifiers in the text. There are two types of tooltips:


#.   Type Info (showing the type of the identifier)
#.   Current Data (showing the data of the identifier)



Standard, when not in Debugging or Profiling mode, the current syntax highlighting editor in Aimms always tries to show the Type Info. When to show the Current Data tooltip instead can be controlled by this option.



*	Never
*	Only During Debugging
*	Only During Profiling
*	During Debugging/Profiling
