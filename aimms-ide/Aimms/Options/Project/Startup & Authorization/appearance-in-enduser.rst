Appearance in End User Mode
===========================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Normal	


This option determines how the AIMMS window appears when an application is started in end user mode. Especially when running a WebUI application on the desktop (not in the cloud)
you probably only want to see the WebUI itself in the browser and not the AIMMS window as well.

    *	Normal
    *	Minimized
    *	Hidden


**Remark**

This option only works when the .aimms file (and not the .aimmspack file) is passed as an argument to the AIMMS executable.  For example if you double click the .aimms file. It does not work when you first open AIMMS and then open the app.


**Tips & Tricks** 

*	This option is mostly used in combination with the option open_webui_on_startup.
