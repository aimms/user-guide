**Type**:	Selection	

**Range**:	The settings listed below	

**Default**:	Last use	



When re-opening a project, AIMMS can restore the layout of docking and floating windows to a state as it was when you previously closed the project. Depending on how flexible you want to make the interface to your end-users (or to yourself), you can specify how to save and restore this state.



Possible values:

*	Last use
*	From project
*	System default
