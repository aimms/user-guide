.. _Options_DM2_Default_data_folder:


Default data folder
===================

Type:	Name of a directory	

Default:	data



This option specifies the folder that AIMMS uses as the default location in the "Open Case File" or "Save Case File" dialog box.

In these dialog boxes the default data folder is shown as a special folder in the folder tree, which makes it easier to keep all your case files together and to find any case file that you saved before.
