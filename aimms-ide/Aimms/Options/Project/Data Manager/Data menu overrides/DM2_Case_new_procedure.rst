.. _Options_DM2_Case_new_procedure:


Case new procedure
==================

:Type:	Name of a procedure	
:Default:	-	



With this option you can override the menu command **Data - New Case** 

If this option is not specified, AIMMS uses built-in code that does the following:


*   check whether current data needs to be saved first,
*   set the 'active case' to none.



Overriding this menu allows you to implement your own data management, or fine-tune the built-in data management.
