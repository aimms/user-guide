Project Documentation
=====================



**Type**:	Name of a documentation file	

**Range**:	Documentation file	

**Default**:	-	



With this option you can specify the name of a file that contains background information on your project. If you specify this option, the Project Documentation command in the Help menu will be enabled. Consequently, when selecting this command the specified document will be opened. AIMMS itself does not open the document, instead it will use the default associated program for the type of file as defined by Windows.
