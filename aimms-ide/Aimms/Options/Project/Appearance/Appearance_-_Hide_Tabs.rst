Hide Tabs
=========



**Type**:	Selection	

**Range**:	The settings listed below	

**Default**:	No	



This option determines whether AIMMS shows the tab selectors on top of the various tabbed editor windows. If you don't really make use of the tab feature in the editor (i.e. usually only have one attribute form open at the same time), you can save some screen space by hiding the tab selectors. Possible values are:



*	No
*	Yes
