Use Subpage Resize Delay
========================



Type:	Selection	

Range:	The settings listed below	

Default:	Off	



With this option you can change the way how AIMMS resizes sub pages of a page. When a page is constructed using many Tabbed Page objects or Indexed Page objects, sometimes the standard resizing mechanism goes wrong, resulting in objects being only partly visible. If this option is set to 'On', then there will be a small delay in resizing the sub pages, but the result is much better.	

Possible values are:



*	On
*	Off
