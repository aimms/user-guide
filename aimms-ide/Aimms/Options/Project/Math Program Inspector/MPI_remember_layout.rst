MPI Remember Layout
===================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	{ No, Yes }	
:Default:	No	

If this option is set to Yes then the layout of the Math program inspector windows is saved as part of the project, such that the next time that you open the application the Math Program Inspector can apply that saved layout.
