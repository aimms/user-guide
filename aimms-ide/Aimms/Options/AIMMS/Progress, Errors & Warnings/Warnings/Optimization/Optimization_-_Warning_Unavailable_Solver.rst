Warning Unavailable Solver
==========================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Error	



This option determines what happens when a mathematical program calls a solver that is not available in the present AIMMS distribution, depending on the following settings:




.. list-table::

   * - *	Off	
     - Do not issue a warning.
   * - *	Warning_collect
     - Issue a warning and post it to the global error and warning collector.
   * - *	Common_warning_default
     - Take action depending on the option 'Common warning default'.
   * - *	Warning_handle
     - Issue a warning and post it to the nearest error handler.
   * - *	Strict_warning_default
     - Take action depending on the option 'Strict warning default'.
   * - *	Error
     - Issue an error.
   * - *	Error_in_develop_else_warning
     - In a developer system same as Error, in a deployment system same as Warning_handle
   * - *	Error_in_develop_else_off
     - In a developer system same as Error, in a deployment system same as Off
   * - *	Warning_in_develop_else_off
     - In a developer system same as Warning_handle, in a deployment system same as Off




**Note** 

*	Regardless of this option, the mathematical program will not be solved if the solver is not available.
*	With the option Maximal Number of Warnings Reported you can set the maximal number of warnings that are shown in errors/warnings and message window.
