Warning Trivial Row
===================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Strict_warning_default



A trivial row is a row that doesn't contain any variables but is satisfied, for example: ``0 <= 1``.

It takes time to generate and subsequently eliminate such rows. When a significant portion of the rows generated by a symbolic
constraint is trivial, the generation of such a constraint seems unduly slow.

What constitutes a significant portion is determined by the option **Warning Trivial Row Minimal Percentage**, but there should
be at least hundred trivial rows before this warning is activated.

This option determines how the unnecessary generation of trivial rows should be reported, depending on the following settings:


.. list-table::

   * - *	Off	
     - Do not issue a warning.
   * - *	Warning_collect
     - Issue a warning and post it to the global error and warning collector.
   * - *	Common_warning_default
     - Take action depending on the option 'Common warning default'.
   * - *	Warning_handle
     - Issue a warning and post it to the nearest error handler.
   * - *	Strict_warning_default
     - Take action depending on the option 'Strict warning default'.
   * - *	Error
     - Issue an error.
   * - *	Error_in_develop_else_warning
     - In a developer system same as Error, in a deployment system same as Warning_handle
   * - *	Error_in_develop_else_off
     - In a developer system same as Error, in a deployment system same as Off
   * - *	Warning_in_develop_else_off
     - In a developer system same as Warning_handle, in a deployment system same as Off


**Note** 

*	With the option **Maximal Number of Warnings Reported** you can set the maximal number of warnings that are shown in errors/warnings and message window.
