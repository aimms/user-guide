Warning Stochastic Programming Scenario Consistency
===================================================



**Type**:	Selection	

**Range**:	The settings listed below	

**Default**:	Common_warning_default	



This option determines whether a consistency check on the scenarios in a stochastic program is executed; In all but the last stage, for coefficients in a group of rows differing only in their scenario index, the coefficients in a column with the same representative scenario should be the same. Whether the consistency check is executed and whether a warning or error is given when the check fails depends on the following settings:




.. list-table::

   * - *	Off	
     - Do not issue a warning.
   * - *	Warning_collect
     - Issue a warning and post it to the global error and warning collector.
   * - *	Common_warning_default
     - Take action depending on the option 'Common warning default'.
   * - *	Warning_handle
     - Issue a warning and post it to the nearest error handler.
   * - *	Strict_warning_default
     - Take action depending on the option 'Strict warning default'.
   * - *	Error
     - Issue an error.
   * - *	Error_in_develop_else_warning
     - In a developer system same as Error, in a deployment system same as Warning_handle
   * - *	Error_in_develop_else_off
     - In a developer system same as Error, in a deployment system same as Off
   * - *	Warning_in_develop_else_off
     - In a developer system same as Warning_handle, in a deployment system same as Off




**Note** 

*	With the option Maximal Number of Warnings Reported you can set the maximal number of warnings that are shown in errors/warnings and message window.
