Warning Empty Index In Database
===============================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	The settings listed below	
:Default:	Common_warning_default	



While reading data from a database (at least) one row is skipped because an empty index was encountered.

This may be unexpected when reading multiple indices. For example: "read I,J from table DB" will create empty sets for both I and J if one of the columns has only empty values.



This situation is ignored, reported as a warning, or interpreted as an error, depending on the following settings:




.. list-table::

   * - *	Off	
     - Do not issue a warning.
   * - *	Warning_collect
     - Issue a warning and post it to the global error and warning collector.
   * - *	Common_warning_default
     - Take action depending on the option 'Common warning default'.
   * - *	Warning_handle
     - Issue a warning and post it to the nearest error handler.
   * - *	Strict_warning_default
     - Take action depending on the option 'Strict warning default'.
   * - *	Error
     - Issue an error.
   * - *	Error_in_develop_else_warning
     - In a developer system same as Error, in a deployment system same as Warning_handle
   * - *	Error_in_develop_else_off
     - In a developer system same as Error, in a deployment system same as Off
   * - *	Warning_in_develop_else_off
     - In a developer system same as Warning_handle, in a deployment system same as Off
