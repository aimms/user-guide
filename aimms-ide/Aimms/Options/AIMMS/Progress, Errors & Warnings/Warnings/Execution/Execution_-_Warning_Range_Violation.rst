**Note** 

*	The setting of this option has effect on both range violations in AIMMS code and in the graphical user interface.
*	The setting of this option has also an effect on the empty statement; because an empty statement is viewed as setting all elements to its default. You may consider moving the default inside the bounds.
*	With the option Maximal Number of Warnings Reported you can set the maximal number of warnings that are shown in errors/warnings and message window.
