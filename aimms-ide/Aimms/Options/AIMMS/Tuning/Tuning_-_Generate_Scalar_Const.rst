.. _Options_Tuning_-_Generate_Scalar_Const:


Generate Scalar Constraints First
=================================



Type:	Selection	

Range:	The settings listed below	

Default:	On	



This option determines the order in which constraints are generated. Normally the order in which constraints are generated (and displayed in the listing file), is the order in which they are declared. When you switch this option 'on', all scalar constraints are generated first. For some models the generation time might improve by switching this option on. Possible values are:



*	On 
*	Off
