Single Column Display
=====================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	One of the settings listed below	
:Default:	Off	



This option determines how AIMMS writes sets and indexed identifiers to listing file. When this option is set to 'Off' AIMMS uses a method to write the data as compact and clear as possible to file. The method used between different AIMMS versions might change. When this option is set to 'On' AIMMS writes the data in a single column to file, thus allowing you to change listing files between different AIMMS versions.
