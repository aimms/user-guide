This option used to determine whether the current basis of the model is saved in a case or not.
In AIMMS the basis is saved as a suffix of variables and constraints by default. Only when the
corresponding options **Save Variable Basics** and **Save Constraint Basics** are turned off and
this option is turned on, the basis will be saved as a part of a symbolic
mathematical program. Possible values are:

    *	Off
    *	On
