Write in Backup Mode Ordering
=============================



:Type:	Selection	
:Range:	One of the settings listed below	
:Default:	AIMMS 3 4	



This option determines in which order identifiers are written to file when executing a write in backup mode. Since the AIMMS 3 0 method can result in problems when reading the file back, we advice only to use this when you want to compare with older AIMMS versions. Possible values are:



    *	AIMMS 3 0
    *	AIMMS 3 4
