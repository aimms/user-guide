Math Program Solution
=====================

**Description** 

By selecting Math Program Solution from the View menu, the Math Program Solution tab is opened. As soon as a solution is available, this tab retrieves information about the mathematical program that has been solved. This information is similar to that in the AIMMS Progress window.



The lower part of the information retrieved by this tab is used to display logging messages resulting from the Bound Analysis and Unreferenced Identifiers commands in the Actions menu.
