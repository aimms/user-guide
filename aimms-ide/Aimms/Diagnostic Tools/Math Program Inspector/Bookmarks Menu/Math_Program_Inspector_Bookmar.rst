Bookmarks
=========

**Description** 

Bookmarks allow you to temporarily tag one or more variables or constraints. A bookmarked nod in the tree will appear in blue text with an exclamation mark in front of the corresponding icon. While navigating through the tree you will always change the current selection, while the bookmarked nodes will not be affected. Whenever you select and/or bookmark a node, all its child nodes plus parent nodes are also selected/bookmarked.



**Toggle Bookmark** 

By selecting Toggle Bookmark from the Bookmarks menu, the selected nodes are bookmarked and appear in blue text. When a node is already bookmarked the bookmark is removed from the node.



**Next Bookmark** 

By selecting Next Bookmark from the Bookmarks menu, the selection jumps to the next bookmarked leaf node in the tree, starting from the beginning of the selection.



**Previous Bookmark** 

By selecting Previous Bookmark from the Bookmarks menu, the selection jumps to the previous bookmarked leaf node in the tree, starting from the beginning of the selection.



**Bookmark Current Selection** 

By selecting Bookmark Current Selection from the Bookmarks menu, you can easily bookmark all selected nodes.



**Select All Bookmarks**
