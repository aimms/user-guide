Tree View
=========

**Description** 

The math program inspector window displays the set of all generated variables and all generated constraints, each in a separate tree (left part of the window). In these trees, the symbolic identifiers are the first-level nodes and on every subsequent level in the tree, one or more indices are fixed. As a result, the individual variables and constraints in your model appear as leaf nodes in the two tree view windows.



**Selection** 

The math program inspector contains several tabs (right part of the window) that retrieve information regarding the selection that has been made in the tree views. Common Windows controls are available to select a subset of variables and constraints (mouse click possibly in combination with the Shift or Control key). Whenever you select a slice (i.e. an intermediate node in the tree) all variables or constraints in that subtree are selected implicitly.
