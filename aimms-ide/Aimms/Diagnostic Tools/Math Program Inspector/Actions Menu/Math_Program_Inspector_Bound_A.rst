Bound Analysis
==============

**Description** 

In some situations it is possible to determine that a math program is infeasible or 
that some of the constraints are redundant even before the math program is solved. 
The bound analysis supports such investigation. 
By choosing the Bound Analysis command from the Actions menu, 
not only infeasibilities and redundancies can be detected, 
but also suggestions to tighten variable bounds and constraint right-hand-sides are offered. 
The results of this analysis can be inspected through the Math Program tab.
