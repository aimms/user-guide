Infeasible Constraints & Violated Bounds
========================================

**Description** 

The currently infeasible constraints are determined by evaluating all constraints in the model using the solution that has been returned by the solver. The currently violated variable bounds and infeasible constraints will be bookmarked in the constraint tree after choosing the Infeasible Constraints & Violated Bounds command from the Actions menu.
