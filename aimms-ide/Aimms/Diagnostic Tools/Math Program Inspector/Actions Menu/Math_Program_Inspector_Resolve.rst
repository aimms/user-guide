Resolve
=======

**Description** 

By selecting Resolve from the Actions menu, the math program is resolved. Note that the resolve command operates on the generated matrix as it is present in the math program inspector (e.g. including changes to the active status of variables and/or constraints).



**Note** 

*	In case of a MIP problem, the basic state and marginal values are not calculated after a resolve (because no postsolve is done).
