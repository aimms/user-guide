Domain Index Display Order
==========================

**Description** 

By default only one index is fixed at every level of the tree views, and the indices are fixed from the left to the right. However, you can override the default index order as well as the subtree depth by using the Variable Property or Constraint Property dialog on the first-level nodes in the tree. These dialogs are displayed when Properties is selected in the Edit menu. The subtree depth is determined by the number of distinct index groups that you have specified in the Property dialog box.
