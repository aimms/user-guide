Analysis Configuration
======================

**Description** 

At the Analysis Configuration tab of the Variable or Constraint Properties dialog you can choose to add a violation variable to the lower and/or upper bound of the variable, or to the left- or right-hand side of the constraint. Furthermore, you can tighten infinite lower and upper bounds. These settings will be used during infeasibility and unboundedness analysis.
