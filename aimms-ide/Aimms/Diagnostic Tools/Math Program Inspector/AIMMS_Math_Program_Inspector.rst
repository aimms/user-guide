AIMMS Math Program Inspector
============================

**Description** 

AIMMS offers a math program inspector to help you in finding causes of infeasibility, unboundedness and unrealistic solutions of your optimization model. The AIMMS math program inspector enables you to analyze both the input and output of a generated optimization model. Furthermore, it allows you to make custom selections of constraints and variables, for which you can inspect statistics of the corresponding matrix and solution.



**Note** 

*	The math program inspector does not support models with complementarity variables (i.e., models with model type MCP or MPCC).
