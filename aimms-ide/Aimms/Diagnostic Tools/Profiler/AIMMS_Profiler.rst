AIMMS Profiler
==============

**Description** 

AIMMS offers a profiler to help you resolve computational time related issues. The AIMMS profiler enables you to locate the most time-consuming evaluations of

*	Procedures and functions,
*	Individual statements within procedures and functions,
*	Defined sets and parameters, and
*	Constraints and defined variables during matrix generation.




As soon as you have activated the profiler, AIMMS will start gathering timing information during every subsequent procedure run or definition evaluation. 





After you have gathered timing information about your modeling application by executing the relevant parts of your application at least once, you can get an overview of the timing results.





With this timing information you can try to locate the procedures and identifier definitions which are most likely to benefit from a reformulation to improve efficiency.
