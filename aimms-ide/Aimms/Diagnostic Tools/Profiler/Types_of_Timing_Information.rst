Types of Timing Information
===========================

**Description** 

The profiler can produce the following different types of information:

*	Hits - the number of times a procedure has been executed or a definition has been evaluated,
*	Gross time - the total time spent in a procedure or definition including the time spent in procedure calls or definition evaluations within the profiled procedure or definition,
*	Net time - the total time spent in a procedure or definition excluding the time spent in procedure calls or definition evaluations within the profiled procedure or definition,
*	Average gross time - the average gross time spent during each separate hit,
*	Average net time - the average net time spent during each separate hit,
*	Min gross time - the minimum gross time spent during a separate hit,
*	Max gross time - the maximum gross time spent during a separate hit,
*	Min net time - the minimum net time spent during a separate hit,
*	Max net time - the maximum net time spent during a separate hit,




The profiler can display this information in various ways: 

*	in extra columns in the attribute window of a procedure or function,
*	via tooltip text, that appears when you hover the mouse over a statement, or
*	in the profiler listing file.

You can choose which information you want to display where via the Profiler Setup dialog box.
