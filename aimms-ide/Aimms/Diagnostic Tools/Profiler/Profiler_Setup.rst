==============

**Description** 

By selecting Setup from the Profiler menu, the Profiler Setup dialog box will be opened. In this dialog you can specify what type of information you want to see in each of the following 5 different situations:

1.	Statement Info in Margin: this is the profiling information of a single statement and is displayed as special columns in a yellow margin in front of each statement in the body of a procedure or function.

2.	Statement Info in Tooltip: this is the profiling information of a single statement and it appears when you move the mouse over the corresponding text in the attribute window.

3.	Procedure Info in Margin: this is the profiling information of an entire procedure (or function). It is displayed as special columns in a yellow margin in the first field of the corresponding attribute window.

4.	Procedure Info in Tooltip: this is the profiling information of an entire procedure (or function). It appears when you move the mouse over a procedure node in the Model Explorer.

5.	Profiler Listing File: this is profiling information of a statement, and it is used to generate the profiler listing file.



In addition to the selection of which information you want to include, you can also specify whether timing information should be displayed in seconds or milliseconds, and which format (width and number of decimals) you want to use for a specific profiler field.

If you uncheck the option Show Profiler Values, the corresponding profiling information will not be shown at all.
