Break on Error
==============

If the menu item **Debugger - Break on Error**  is checked, the debugger will automatically break on a statement in which an execution error is triggered.



With this feature you can have a close look at why a certain error is triggered, as you can inspect all the related data that is used within the statement.



By default, in a new AIMMS session, the **Break on Error**  feature is disabled.
