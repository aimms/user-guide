AIMMS Debugger
==============

**Description** 

To help you track down errors that are the result of misformulations in assignment statements or in the definitions of defined parameters in your model, AIMMS provides a source debugger. Activating the debugger will add a Debug menu to the system menu bar, and, in addition, add the Debug toolbar to the toolbar area.



Using the debugger, you can

*	Set conditional and unconditional breakpoints on a statement within the body of a procedure or function of your model, as well as on the evaluation of set and parameter definitions,
*	Step through the execution of procedures, functions and definitions, and
*	Observe the effect of single statements and definitions on the data within your model, either through tooltips within the observed definitions and procedure bodies, or through separate data pages.
