Call Stack Dialog Box
=====================

**Description** 

You can open the Call Stack dialog by selecting Call Stack from the Debugger menu when the debugger is active. 

In the Call Stack dialog you get a detailed overview of the stack of procedure calls associated with the current line of execution. It enables you to observe the flow of execution at the level of procedures associated with the current position of the breakpoint pointer. After selecting a procedure, function, or defined identifier in the Call Stack dialog, the Show Position button will open its attribute window at the indicated line.
