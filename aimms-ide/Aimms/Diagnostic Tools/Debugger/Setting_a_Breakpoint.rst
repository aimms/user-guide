Setting a Breakpoint
====================

**Description** 

Breakpoints in the model tree can be placed in the body of a procedure or function, or on the definition of an identifier, by opening the corresponding attribute window and set a breakpoint, or by setting a breakpoint directly on the corresponding node in the model explorer.



To set a breakpoint in the attribute window of a procedure, function, or defined identifier:

1.	Open the model explorer.

2.	Activate the debugger.

3.	Open the attribute window of the procedure, function, or defined identifier.

In the attribute window you can either:

4.	Select the line where you want to insert the breakpoint (in the body attribute in procedure or function, in the definition attribute in defined identifier).

5.	Select Breakpoints – Insert/Remove from the Debugger menu.

Or:

6.	Click the right-mouse button in the yellow margin at the left side of the line where you want to position the breakpoint.

7.	From the popup menu, select Insert Breakpoint.



To set a breakpoint on a node in the model explorer:

1.	Open the model explorer.

2.	Activate the debugger.

3.	Select the node on which you want to set the breakpoint.

4.	Select Breakpoint – Insert/Remove from the Debugger menu.



**Note** 

*	After you have set a breakpoint this is made visible by a red dot in the left margin of the selected source line and the red color of the node in the model tree.
*	When you specify a breakpoint on a node in the model explorer, the breakpoint will be added to the first statement contained in the body of the selected procedure or function, or to the definition attribute in case of a defined identifier.
