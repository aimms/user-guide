**Description** 



Working with AIMMS is working with AIMMS projects. A project consists of three basic parts, a Model, Pages and Data. In the model you can describe and solve a mathematical problem. The pages can be used to display and change data, as well as to let the user execute (part of) the model. The data is used to save (and load) data sets for future reference.



AIMMS has user friendly tools to construct projects. A Model can be built with the Model Explorer and the identifiers in the model can be viewed using the Identifier Selector and View Manager. Pages can be constructed with the Page Manager and enhanced with the Template Manager and Menu Builder.



Once you have constructed a project in AIMMS in Development mode, you can let other people use the project in End-User mode. 



Besides this Help System, you can also consult the AIMMS documentation to help you with your question about AIMMS.
