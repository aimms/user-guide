Authorization Levels
====================

**Description** 

The model developer can define a set of authorization levels with the project. The use of authorization levels makes it possible to protect access to model functionality without explicit references to user names. The contents of this set can only be changed using the Authorization Level Setup Tool. At startup of a project this set will be initialized correctly. 



All authorization levels are maintained in the Authorization Level Tree. The Authorization Level Tree is very restricted in the sense that it only allows a single root node. All level nodes are child nodes of this root node.
