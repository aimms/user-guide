User Setup Tool
===============

**Description** 

In the User Setup Tool you can manage all the user accounts for your application. This tool is available via a dialog box containing a tree in which all the groups and users are represented. In this tree, you can simply create, modify or delete users and groups, using similar commands as in all other AIMMS trees.



To open the User Setup Tool:

1.	If your project is not linked to a user database file, you must first create a link to a new or existing user database file.

If the project is already linked to a user database file:

2.	From the Settings â€“ User Setup submenu, select the Edit command.

3.	If the User Database is password protected, you will be prompted for the User Administrator password.
