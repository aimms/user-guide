User Node Property - Access
===========================

**Description** 

On the Access tab you can indicate which access flags are set for any case or dataset that is created by the specific user.



**User Read/Write** 

These access flags are used when the user himself tries to access one of his own cases or datasets.



**Group Read/Write** 

These access flags are used when another user from the same user group tries to access one of the user's cases or datasets. 



**Higher Group Read/Write** 

These access flags are used when another user from a user group that is higher in the User Tree tries to access one of the user's cases or datasets. 



**Lower Group Read/Write** 

These access flags are used when another user from a user group that is lower in the User Tree tries to access one of the user's cases or datasets. 



**Other Read/Write** 

These access flags are used when another user who does not fall in any of the above categories tries to access one of the user's cases or datasets. 



**Developers Access Allowed** 

This access flag is not used in combination with cases or datasets. It is used to grant (or deny) access to a project in developer mode.
