User Tree Node Properties
=========================

**Description** 

Node properties specify characteristics of a node in the User Tree. Each type of node has its own properties that can be specified in more detail.



To view or modify the node 

*	From the right-mouse popup menu, select the Properties command, or
*	Double-click on the node in the User Tree. 




Node properties are divided into the following categories.

*	:ref:`Security_User_Node_Property_-_Propertie`  
*	:ref:`Security_User_Node_Property_-_Password`  
*	:ref:`Security_User_Node_Property_-_Access`  
*	:ref:`Security_User_Node_Property_-_Database`  

Every category is displayed on its own tab in the Properties dialog box. 





**Remark** 


Several properties are also equipped with an inherit checkbox. If the inherit flag is checked, the value of the property is inherited from its parent node in the User Tree. By using these inherits flag, it is possible to change properties for all users in a group by only changing the properties of the group itself.
