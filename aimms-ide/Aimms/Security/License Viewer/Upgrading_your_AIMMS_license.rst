Upgrading your AIMMS license
============================

**Description** 

You will be able to use the AIMMS system as long as your license is not yet expired. 
As long as the maintenance expiration date is not expired you will be able to run 
AIMMS upgrades available from the AIMMS web site at `AIMMS <https://www.aimms.com>`_.



When you want to upgrade other license characteristics (for example the availability of solvers) 
you should contact AIMMS in order to obtain a new license file.
