AIMMS Maintenance Expiration Date
=================================

**Description** 

The AIMMS maintenance expiration date specifies what AIMMS versions you can use. You can only use those AIMMS versions for which the functional release has been issued before the maintenance expiration date of your system. 



For example, the functional release AIMMS 3.2 was issued in May 2001. If you have an AIMMS system with Maintenance expiration date December 31, 2001, you can use the AIMMS 3.2 functional release, and all bugfix releases on AIMMS 3.2, even if these bugfix releases are issued in 2002. However the next functional release, AIMMS 3.3, cannot be used, since it is issued later than December 31, 2001.



Use the AIMMS License Viewer to inspect the AIMMS Maintenance Date for your system.



If you still want to use new AIMMS versions, but your maintenance expiration date does not allow it, you can apply with AIMMS B.V. for backmaintenance.
