AIMMS License Summary
=====================

**Description** 

The License Configuration dialog box displays information about the available AIMMS licenses. To open the License Configuration dialog box,

1.	From the Tools menu, select the License â€“ License Configuration... command.



The License Configuration dialog box displays information about

*	The license file that is used (or the name of the network license server),
*	The license number,
*	The license type (Educational, Developer, End-User, Component),
*	The license size (Small, Medium, Large),
*	The start date of the license,
*	The license expiration date of the license,
*	The maintenance expiration date,
*	The AIMMS version supported,
*	Number of concurrent sessions.
*	Allowed solvers.




The license type and size determine what kind of solvers and what kind of models can be handled with AIMMS. The start and expiration date determine in which period AIMMS can be used. The maintenance expiration date and AIMMS version supported determine what AIMMS bugfix releases you can run. You can run an AIMMS bugfix release if it is of the same functional release as the AIMMS version supported or if the release date of the corresponding functional release was before the maintenance expiration date. 





For more information about any of the license specifics, contact us or look on our website `AIMMS <https://www.aimms.com>`_.
