Node Selector
=============

**Description** 

A Node Selector consists of a static list of (manually selected) nodes from the Model Explorer tree. In its simplest form, the list only contains references to the individual identifiers in the selection, but additionally, you can include sections, procedures or functions in the list. When constructing the resulting list of identifiers AIMMS will include all identifiers that are declared within these sections, procedures and functions.
