Conditional Selector
====================

**Description** 

A Conditional Selector consists of some simple conditions, which are used to (dynamically) construct a list of identifiers. The types of conditions that can be applied are based upon:

*	the identifier type (such as parameter, variable, set, …),
*	the existence of a particular attribute of the identifier, and/or
*	the textual contents of a particular attribute of the identifier.




For example, you can use a Conditional Selector to obtain:

*	all the constraints in your model,
*	all variables with a non-empty definition, or
*	all identifiers that contain some specific string in its comment attribute.
