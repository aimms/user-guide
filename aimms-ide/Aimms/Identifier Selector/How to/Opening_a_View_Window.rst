Open a View Window
==================

**Description** 

You can open a new View Window, using the Open with command, from within one of the following AIMMS windows:

*	The Model Explorer. If you select one or more nodes in the model tree, then when opening a View Window, it will show all the identifiers that are contained in these nodes. For example, if you select a Declaration section, then all identifiers in this section will be displayed in the View Window.
*	The Identifier Selector. If you select one or more selector nodes in this tree, then when opening a View Window, it will show the resulting selection of identifiers.
*	Another View Window. If you select some of the identifiers in an existing View Window, then you can choose to view these identifiers in a second View Window (using another View Definition).
