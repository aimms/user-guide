Change the rows of a View Window
================================

**Description** 

The initial list of identifiers that are displayed in a View Window is derived from the nodes that you selected in the Model Explorer or Identifier Selector at the time you invoked the Open with command. Once created, the list of identifier is maintained as a local list of the View Window (without any links to how this list was initially created). This means that you can freely modify the list of identifiers that is displayed in the View Window.



You can add new identifiers to a View Window by dragging nodes from either the Model Explorer, the Identifier Selector or another View Window into the current View Window. If you want to add identifiers from the Model Explorer or another View Window, then you can also use the copy and paste commands

1.	Select the nodes in the Model Explorer or another View Window.

2.	From the Edit menu, select Copy.

3.	In the destination View Window, select the row where you want to insert the identifiers.

4.	From the Edit menu, select Paste.

If you try to add identifiers that are already present in the View Window, then these identifiers are skipped and not added again.



To remove identifiers from a View Window:

1.	Select the rows you want to remove (by clicking on the icon).

2.	From the Edit menu, select Delete.



You can order the identifiers in a View Window based on the alphabetical order of their attribute values by simply clicking on the column header of that attribute. To re-arrange the row order manually you can drag the rows to other positions or use a cut and paste sequence:

1.	Select the rows you want to move to another position (by clicking on the icons).

2.	From the Edit menu, select Cut.

3.	Select the row to where you want to move the rows.

4.	From the Edit menu, select Paste.



**Tips & Tricks** 

*	If you have created a specific list of identifiers in your View Window, and you want to store this list for future reference, then you can invoke the Contents-Save command from the View menu. This will create a new Node Selector in the Identifier Selector tool.
