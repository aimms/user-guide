Change the columns of a View Window
===================================

**Description** 

The view definition that is used to create the View Window determines the initial contents and layout of the columns in the View Window. However, once you have the View Window opened, you can modify this initial appearance. You can 

*	change the width of each column by dragging the divider lines between each column in the header bar at the top of the window, and
*	change which attributes are shown (and in which order) using the command Properties from the View menu. This will bring up the View Definition Properties dialog box.

The changes that you make to the columns will not directly change the original View Definition. To save the changes you should invoke the command Save from the File menu. If you try to close the window without saving the changes to the columns, then AIMMS will ask whether you want to save the changes.





**Tips & Tricks** 

*	You can access the View Definition Properties dialog box also by clicking the right-mouse button in the header bar of the View Window.
