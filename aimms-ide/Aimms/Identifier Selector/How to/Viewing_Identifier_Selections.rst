View Identifier Selections
==========================

**Description** 

Although the Model Explorer is a very convenient tool to organize all the information in your model, it doesn't allow you to obtain a simultaneous overview of a group of identifiers that share certain aspects of your model. By mutual comparison of the important attributes (like the definition), such overviews may help you to further structure the contents of your model, or to discover oversights in a formulation.

In the attribute form of an identifier you can explore all the attributes of that specific identifier. However, if you want to compare or simultaneously edit the attributes of multiple identifiers, just opening a single attribute form is not sufficient anymore. For this task, AIMMS offers special View Windows.

A View Window allows you to view one (or more) attributes simultaneously for a number of identifiers. Such a View Window is presented in the form of a table, where each row represents a single identifier and each column corresponds to specific attributes. The first column always contains a type-specific icon, the second column always contains the identifier name.

To open a View Window in AIMMS you first need to select the identifiers that you want to display and then pick a View Definition from the View Manager. A View Definition defines which attributes should appear as the columns of a View Window. For every newly created project, AIMMS creates a number of View Definitions that you can use directly, but you are free to create new view definitions or modify existing ones.
