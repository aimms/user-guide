Modify a Node Selector via Drag-and-Drop
========================================

A Node Selector consists of a list of references to nodes in the model tree. This list can be managed using the Properties of the Node Selector, but you can also extend the list with new references using a simple drag-and-drop operation:

1.	Open the Model Explorer.

2.	Open the Identifier Selector.

3.	In the Model Explorer, select the node(s) that you want to add to a Node Selector.

4.	Drag the selected nodes from the Model Explorer to the Identifier Selector.

When dragging over a Node Selector, the cursor will change to |img_def_Add_Into_bmp| 

5.	Drop the nodes on the specific Node Selector.
