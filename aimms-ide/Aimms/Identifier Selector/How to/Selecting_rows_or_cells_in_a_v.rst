Select rows or cells in a view window
=====================================

**Description** 

In a View Window you can make two types of selections:

*	You can select a single cell (only the cell itself is highlighted). If you select a single cell, you are able to change its contents (the attribute value), or copy its contents to another cell.
*	You can select one or more rows (the entire row is highlighted). If you select an entire row, you are actually referring to the identifier and are thus able to remove the identifier from the view, drag it to another position or even to another View Window.

If you use the mouse to make a selection in a View Window, you click on the icons at the left to select an entire row, and on any other part of the row to select the specific cell.


If you want to use the keyboard to navigate through the cells and/or rows, you can use the left and right arrow keys to switch between a row selection and a cell selection. If you select the cell containing the icon, the entire row will be selected. Once a row is selected, then both the left and right arrow key will switch to a selection of a cell.
