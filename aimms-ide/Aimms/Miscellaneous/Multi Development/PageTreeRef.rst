Page Tree Reference
===================

**Description** 

When working with multiple libraries it is possible to refer to a page (and its subpages) in one of the libraries from within the main page tree. This can be useful when you want the pages in a library to be part of the normale page navigation sequence in case you use for example Next and Previous buttons, a Navigation Object, or a Tabbed Pages object.



To make a new page tree reference:

1.	Open the page manager and click on the position where you want the reference.

2.	From the Edit menu select New - Page Tree Reference.

Now to link an existing page from a library to the new page tree reference:

1.	Select both the page tree reference and the paghe you want to be linked while holding down the Ctrl key.

2.	Release the Ctrl key and from the Edit menu select Page Tree Reference - Link.

	

You can unlink in a similar way via the Edit - Page Tree Reference - Unlink menu item and you have the possibility to highlight the page or page tree reference that is being linked by selecting its counterpart and using the Edit - Page Tree Reference - Show Linked Node menu item.
