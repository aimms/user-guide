Library Manager
===============



**Description** 

In the Library Manager you can Add New Library to divide your project in different parts for developing with multiple developers, or you can Add Existing Library to link an existing library to your model.



Each library will result in a separate root node in all the development tools. The contents of these root nodes will be stored in the separate library project and model file.
