Startup Bitmap
==============

**Description** 

When you startup AIMMS a standard splash screen is displayed. If you startup AIMMS with your project as a command line argument, then you can replace this standard AIMMS splash screen with your own splash screen. To achieve this you should create a bitmap file that contains your own splash screen and save this bitmap as <project-name>.bmp in the project directory.



**Note** 

*	The project specific splash screen is only shown at startup of AIMMS and not if you open the project using the Open Project command from the File menu
