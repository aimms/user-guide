Name Change File
================

**Description** 

When you change the name of an identifier in the model, the change is saved in the name change file ("<project-name>.nch"). All occurrences of the name in the model will also be changed. Still, it is possible that AIMMS encounters the old name, for example when loading a case, or opening page. When AIMMS does encounter a reference to the old name, the new name can be substituted with use of the name change file. You can commit the name changes in pages and menu by executing the menu command Tools â€“ Commit Name Changes.
