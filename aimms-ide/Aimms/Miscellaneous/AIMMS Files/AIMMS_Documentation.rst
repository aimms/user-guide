AIMMS Documentation
===================

**Description** 

AIMMS comes with three books, the User's Guide, the Language Reference, and Optimization Modeling. The first two books emphasize different aspects in the use of the AIMMS system, while the third book is a general introduction to optimization modeling. All books can be used independently. All three books also have an electronic version in PDF format, which can be read using the Acrobat PDF reader. These three PDF files are found in the "Doc" subfolder in the folder where AIMMS is installed. Each book can be opened from within AIMMS by selecting the associated item in the Help menu.



There is a fourth book, which is only available as an electronic version, the function reference. The function reference gives a description for every function and predeclared identifier that is supported by AIMMS.

Some features of AIMMS have documentation of their own. This documentation (in .pdf format) can also be found in the "Doc" subfolder of the folder where AIMMS is installed.
