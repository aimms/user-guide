Cut, Copy and Paste in AIMMS Trees
==================================

**Description** 

With the |img_def_Cut_button_bmp| Cut, |img_def_Copy_Button_bmp| Copy and |img_def_Paste_button_bmp| Paste items from the Edit menu or right-mouse menu you can cut or copy the current selection from the tree, and paste it elsewhere. In addition to the usual way of pasting, which copies information from one position to the other, AIMMS also supports the Paste as Duplicate operation. This form of pasting makes no actual copy of the node but only stores a reference to it. In this way changes in one node are also reflected in the other.



Duplicate nodes in AIMMS trees are indicated with a box |img_def_Duplicate_bmp| in the lower right corner of the node icon.



**Remark** 

The Paste as Duplicate operation is not available in the Page Manager. A few examples of nodes that can have duplicates are templates (template manager) and menu items (menu builder).
