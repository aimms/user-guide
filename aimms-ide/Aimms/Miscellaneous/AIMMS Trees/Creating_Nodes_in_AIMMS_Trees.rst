Creating Nodes in AIMMS Trees
=============================

**Description** 

When you want to add child nodes to a branch, you must first expand the branch. Without expansion, a new node will be inserted directly below the branch, and not as its child node. Expanding an empty branch will result in an empty subtree being displayed. To insert a new node after expansion

1.	Select an existing node below which you want to insert a node.

2.	From the Edit menu, select Insert.
