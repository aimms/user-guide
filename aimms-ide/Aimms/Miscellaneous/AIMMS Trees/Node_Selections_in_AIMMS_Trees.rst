Node Selections in AIMMS Trees
==============================

**Description** 

Unlike the Windows√î Explorer, the AIMMS tree explorer lets you make multiple selections within the model tree that you can use for deletion, cut, copy and paste, or drag and drop. The nodes in a selection do not even have to lie within the same branch. By left clicking in combination with holding down the <Ctrl> key you can add or delete single nodes to the selection. By left clicking in combination with holding down the <Shift> key you can add all nodes between the current node and the last selected node.
