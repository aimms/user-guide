Traversing AIMMS Trees
======================

**Description** 

Branches in a tree (i.e. intermediate nodes with child nodes) have a small expansion box in front containing either a plus |img_def_Tree_Plus_Sign_bmp| or a minus |img_def_Tree_Minus_Sign_bmp| sign. Collapsed branches have a plus sign, and can be expanded one level by a single clicking on the plus sign (to show more information). Expanded branches have a minus sign, and can be collapsed by a single clicking on the minus sign (to show less information). Alternatively, a node can be expanded or collapsed by double clicking on its icon. Leaf nodes have no associated expansion box. By double clicking on the name of the node in the tree, the attribute form will become available.



**Tips & Tricks** 

*	For all AIMMS trees, except for the model tree, when expanding a branch while holding down the <Ctrl> or <Shift> key, all subbranches will be expanded too.
*	For the model tree, when expanding a branch while holding down the ``<Ctrl>``  key, all subbranches will be expanded too. When expanding a branch while holding down the ``<Shift>``  key, all subbranches will be expanded too, except for Declaration Sections.
