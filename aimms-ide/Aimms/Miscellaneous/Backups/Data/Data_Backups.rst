Data Backups
============

**Description** 

The Data Backup feature of AIMMS allows you to create automatic backups of your current data at regular time intervals. These backups may protect you against accidental loss of the currently specified data (caused by an unexpected software or hardware failure). At any time, you can reload the data of a backup into your current model.

The data backup files are stored in the backup directory of your application. Similarly as with project backups, you can specify how many separate backup files you want to retain.
