Automatic
=========

**Description** 

You can setup your project such that it automatically creates backups of your current data at regular time intervals:

1.	From the Settings menu, select AutoSave & Backups â€“ Data

In the Data Backups dialog box

2.	Select At Regular Time Intervals and specify the number of minutes between two backups.

3.	Click OK



You can maintain more than one backup of your data. AIMMS can manage the backup files based upon the date and time on which they are created. You can specify the maximum number of backups that you want to keep that are dated today, and the number of backups of previous days (only the newest backup of a day). Every time AIMMS creates a new backup, it will remove any automatically created backup file that does no longer comply with these specifications.
