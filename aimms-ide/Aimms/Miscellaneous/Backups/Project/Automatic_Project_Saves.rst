Automatic Project Saves
=======================

**Description** 

During the development of your model and graphical user interface, you are advised to regularly save the last modifications, using the command Save Project from the File menu. This may prevent you from accidental loss of data in case of a software or hardware failure. Besides manually saving the project, you can also let AIMMS save the project at regular time intervals:

1.	From the Settings menu, select AutoSave & Backups â€“ Project

2.	Select the option At Regular Time Intervals, and specify the number of minutes between each save.

3.	Click OK.



**Note** 

*	The automatic project save is not exactly the same as a manual save. For example, to prevent from saving only partially typed model texts, outstanding edits in an attribute window are not saved unless you have applied these changes to the model. As a result, the * in the main title of the AIMMS window (which indicates that the project is changed) is not removed after an automatic project save and, when closing the project, you are still asked to save the project manually as well.
