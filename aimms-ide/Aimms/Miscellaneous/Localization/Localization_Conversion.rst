**Description** 

The Localization Conversion tool of AIMMS helps you to convert all text that you have already specified statically (i.e. without using a string parameter) in your pages and menus. When you execute the command, it will search through all pages and menus and replace any static text by a reference to the Localized Text Parameter (which is created by the Localization Setup).



**Note** 

Before you can use this conversion tool, you must run the Localization Setup for your project.
