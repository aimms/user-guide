Text Wizard
===========

**Description** 

After you have setup your application for localization, you can use the Localized Text wizard to create and maintain all the language specific strings. If you select Show Strings from the Tools-Localization menu, a dialog box is shown in which you can easily create new string entries and/or specify the text for any of the languages of your application. In this dialog, AIMMS makes sure that the proper language strings are read from and written to the specific folder of the Project User Files. Additionally, if you create new strings, then the Definition of the integer set LocalizedTextIndexSet is changed accordingly.



The Localized Text wizard can also be used directly from within the dialog boxes where AIMMS expects you to fill in a scalar string parameter (for example in the Button properties dialog box, to specify the text on the button). In such places, if you click on the wizard button at the right side of the edit field, a popup menu appears with a Localized Text item. If you select this command, the Localized Text wizard is shown. In the wizard dialog box, you can select any of the existing entries, or create and select a new entry.
