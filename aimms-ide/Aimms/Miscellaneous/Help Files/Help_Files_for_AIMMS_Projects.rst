Help files for AIMMS projects
=============================

**Description** 

The application developer has the possibility to associate a help file, like this one, with an AIMMS project. The help file can be made with a help-authorizing tool such as RoboHelp. You can specify what help file is associated with a project via the Application help file option. At this moment, AIMMS supports three different kind of help formats: Windows help (.hlp), HTMP help (.chm), and Acrobat help (.pdf). 



You can associate help topics with pages, page objects, and menu items, by entering the associated keywords in the Help Topic field on the tabs of the Properties dialog box. You can call the help, as an end-user, by selecting What's This from the Help menu and pointing to the object or page you want the help about. This means that if you want your pages to be equipped with help, you should have the What's This menu item available, either in the menu or the toolbar.



Depending on the type of file that has been specified as the Application help file, the Help Topic needs to correspond to a k-keyword in a Windows Help file, a keyword in a compiled HTML Help file, or a named destination in a PDF Help file. Make sure that the Help Topic exists in the Application Help file.
