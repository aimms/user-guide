:Long Name:	--license	
:Argument:	License	

Through the --license option you can select any Aimms license that you installed in the Aimms License Configuration dialog box. The value that you specify for the 
--license option should match an entry in the License column in the left pane of the 
License Configuration dialog box. In case you are using a network license with different
profiles, you should make a different entry in the Aimms License Configuration for each profile you want to use and you can use the --license option to open Aimms with a license with a specific profile.
