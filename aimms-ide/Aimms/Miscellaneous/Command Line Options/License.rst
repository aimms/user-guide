:Long Name:	\--license	
:Argument:	License	

Through the \--license option you can select any AIMMS license that you installed in the AIMMS License Configuration dialog box. The value that you
specify for the \--license option should match an entry in the License column in the left pane of the 
License Configuration dialog box. In case you are using a network license with different
profiles, you should make a different entry in the AIMMS License Configuration for each profile you want to use and you can use the \--license option
to open AIMMS with a license with a specific profile.
