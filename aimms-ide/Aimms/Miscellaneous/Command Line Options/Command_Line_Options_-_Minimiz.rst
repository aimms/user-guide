Minimized
=========



Long Name:	--minimized	

Short Name:	-m	

Argument:	<none>	

Description:	Through the --minimized option you can indicate whether you want AIMMS to start in a minimized state (i.e. just as a button on the task bar), or filling up the entire screen. Running AIMMS minimized may be convenient when AIMMS is called non-interactively from within another program for instance, to solve an optimization model after which the calling program resumes its execution.
