:Long Name:	\--hidden	
:Short Name:	<none>	
:Argument:	<none>	

Through the \--hidden option you can indicate whether you want to run AIMMS without showing any window or button on the task bar. Running AIMMS in a hidden state may be convenient when AIMMS is called non-interactively from within another program for instance, to solve an optimization model after which the calling program resumes its execution. If you use this option the standard AIMMS window is not available, thus you should make sure that the program that calls AIMMS performs all necessary steps for opening a project, executing procedures, and closing AIMMS afterwards.
