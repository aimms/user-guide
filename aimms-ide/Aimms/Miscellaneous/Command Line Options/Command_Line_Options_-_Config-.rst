:Long Name:	\--config-dir	
:Short Name:	-C	
:Argument:	Configuration directory	

By default, AIMMS stores a number of global configuration files, such as the AIMMS license files and the solver configuration file, in the common application area of your computer. If you want to store configuration files in a different location,
you can indicate this through the \--config-dir option. You can use this option, for instance, to indicate where the license files for your particular machine can be found, when the AIMMS system that you use is stored on a network disk, and you do not use a license server.
