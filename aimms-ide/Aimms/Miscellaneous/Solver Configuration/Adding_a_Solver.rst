Adding a Solver
===============

To add a solver:

1.	Open the Solver Configuration dialog box.

2.	Click Add.

The Solver Configuration Data dialog box appears.

3.	At the Solver DLL field, type a full path for the solver dll file or select a solver dll file using the File Selection dialog box |img_def_Wizard_Button_bmp|.

If AIMMS can find the necessary information in the Solver DLL, the Description and Type field will be filled.

4.	Optionally modify the text in the Description field.

5.	Optionally enter arguments for the solver in the Arguments field.

6.	Click OK to accept the new solver.

7.	Click OK to close the Solver Configuration dialog box.



**Note** 

*	If you add a solver with a 'new' model type, AIMMS will add a new column for that model type to the Solver Configuration dialog box.
*	Changes take effect immediately.
