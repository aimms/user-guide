Goto Line
=========

**Description** 

When you are editing in the model tree nodes, you have the possibility to directly go to a line of a specific argument. This is especially useful when you are dealing with the body of a procedure or the initial data of a set with multiple lines. You can go to a specific line by selecting the window and selecting Goto Line from the Edit menu. A dialog box will appear in which you can specify the line number.
