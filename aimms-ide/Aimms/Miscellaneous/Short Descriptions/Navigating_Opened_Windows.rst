Navigating the open Windows
===========================

**Description** 

While working with AIMMS you might end up with a lot of pages, attribute windows etc. being open on your screen. In the Window menu there are some commands that allow you to more easily switch between these opened windows and/or to close most of the opened windows.



Please note that these commands are only applicable for the non-docking windows.



**Next Window (Ctrl-F6)** 

With this command you can go to the next window in the current list of opened windows.



Note that with the shortcut Ctrl-Tab you can also switch to the docking windows!



**Close All Windows** 

With this command you can close all the currently opened (non-docking) windows. If any window needs saving, you will be prompted to do so.



**Close All Other Windows** 

With this command you can close all the currently opened (non-docking) windows, except the one that you are currently working on. If any window needs saving, you will be prompted to do so.



**Windows...** 

This command opens a dialog box in which all the currently opened windows are listed. In this dialog you can select the window to navigate to.
