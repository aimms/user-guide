**Description** 

AIMMS is equipped with special pages, print templates, to allow you to print all the data you want in page objects. You also have the possibility to print regular pages. When you use this print it will work like a screen capture, what you see on screen is what you get on paper. You can print by selecting Print from the File menu. When you print a page that is not a print template page, you can specify the paper size in a dialog box, similar to the print template â€“ paper type dialog box. You can also print part of the model tree. You can select a part, or print the whole model, to a printer or to an ascii file.
