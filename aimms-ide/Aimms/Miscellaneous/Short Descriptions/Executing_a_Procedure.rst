Executing a Procedure
=====================

**Description** 

There are many different ways to let AIMMS execute a procedure in your model. For example you can choose to let AIMMS execute a program when you open your project, when you open a specific page, when you click a button, or when you change a value in a table. These features are useful when making an end-user project. There are also two possibilities to execute procedures directly, which can be used for test purpose. One possibility is to select Procedureâ€¦ from the Run menu and select the procedure in the dialog box that appears. The other method is to select a procedure in the model tree and select Run Procedure from the right mouse menu.
