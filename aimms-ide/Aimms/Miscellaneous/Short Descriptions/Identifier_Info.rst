Identifier Info
===============

**Description** 

If you know the name of an identifier in your model, then an easy way to either go to its declaration in the Model Explorer, its Attribute Window or its Data Page is to use the Identifier Info dialog box (which has as shortcut key F11).



In this dialog box you can enter the name of the identifier and then press one of the three buttons: Declaration, Attributes or Data



When typing the identifier name, you can use the standard name completion key sequence (Ctrl-(Shift-)Space) to complete the name to an existing identifier name in your model. If in different scopes (such as libraries, modules, local declarations in procedures) there are multiple identifiers with the exact same name, then these alternatives are presented in the dialog box, and you can pick the one you are currently interested in.



Please note that a similar 'Declaration' button is also available in the :ref:`Miscellaneous_Find__Replace`  dialog box.
