Scalar Object in User Mode
==========================

**Description** 

Editing the values in a scalar object is quite intuitive, except maybe for some small details:

*	If the object uses a display style that does not show the edit field permanently (i.e. the styles Value(s) only, Text â€“ Value, or Value Text), then you can enter a completely new value by simply start typing this new value. If you want to modify the current value, you should first press the F2 or Ins key.
*	If the scalar object has the Multiple Line Edit Field style, then you should press Ctrl-Enter to insert a line break within the text. Pressing the Enter key alone accepts the current text.
*	If you press the Esc key, your current edits will be discarded and the original value is put back.




**Note** 

*	You can only change the value of an identifier if the scalar object is not read-only and if the identifier is in the set CurrentInputs, which generally means that the identifier should not have a definition.
