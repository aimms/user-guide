Keep Page Open
==============

**Description** 

An end-user application in AIMMS normally contains a number of pages. Via buttons and navigation objects, the end-user will be guided through these pages, whereby the visited pages are usually closed automatically. Sometimes however, the end-user might want to keep a specific page opened, because he wants to inspect two or more pages simultaneously. Via the command |img_def_Keep_Open_button_bmp| Keep Page Opened in the View menu, you can switch the keep open state of a page on or off. If the keep open state is activated, then AIMMS will not close the page unless it is closed explicitly by the end-user ifself.
