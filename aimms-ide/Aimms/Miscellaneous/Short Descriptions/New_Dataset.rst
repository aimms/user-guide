New Dataset
===========

**Description** 

With the New Dataset command from the Data menu you can instruct AIMMS to start a new, unnamed, active dataset for a specific data category. However, the data in the active dataset will remain unchanged.

When you select this command, a dialog box will pop up, in which you can select the data category for which you want to start the new dataset.



**Note** 

You can also start a new dataset using the interface function DatasetNew. In that case, you need to specify the data category as an argument, and the dialog box to select the data category will not appear.
