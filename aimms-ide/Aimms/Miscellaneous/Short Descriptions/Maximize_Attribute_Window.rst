Maximize Attribute Window
=========================

**Description** 

When you are making large edits in a specific field of an attribute window (for example when specifying the body of a procedure), the specific field within the window may be too small to edit conveniently. Therefore, AIMMS allows you to maximize such a field within the attribute window, by selecting Maximized from the Edit menu or click the Maximize button |img_def_Maximize_Window_button_bmp| in the toolbar. When you have maximized a specific attribute field, this field is resized to fit the entire attribute window (temporarily hiding the other attributes). Additionally, this maximized field is equipped with a horizontal scrollbar. To go back to the regular attribute window, you can once again select Maximized from the Edit menu or click the Maximize button |img_def_Maximize_Window_button_bmp| in the toolbar again, or click the Restore normal size button |img_def_Minimized_Window_button_bmp| at the top-right of the window.



**Note** 

*	Only attributes that accept multiple lines of input can be maximized.
