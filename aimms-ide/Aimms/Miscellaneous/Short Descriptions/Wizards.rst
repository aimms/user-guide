**Description** 

When AIMMS requires you to specify information in dialog boxes or attribute windows, you often have the possibility to use a wizard |img_def_Wizard_button_bmp|. Instead of typing information, a wizard allows you to select information by 'point and click'. This makes it not only more clear what kind of information AIMMS expects from you, but also guarantees that the information will be given in a format that AIMMS accepts.

When you click on a wizard button, AIMMS will pop up a :ref:`Miscellaneous_Dialog_Box` . A dialog box that is opened by a wizard button is usually referred to as a Wizard. 

A wizard that is used very often (whenever AIMMS requires you to specify a model identifier) is the Identifier Selection dialog box. Attribute wizards help you specify the attributes on an attribute form.
