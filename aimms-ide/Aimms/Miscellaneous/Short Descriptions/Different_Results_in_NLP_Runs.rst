Different Results in NLP Runs
=============================

**Description** 

The result of a NLP is not only influenced by the model, but can also be influenced by the following three items:

-	Scaling

-	Starting point

-	Setting of option Accept Basis



If you want to guarantee the same solution for subsequent solves of NLP problems, you should make sure that the scaling and starting point are the same and that the option Accept Basis is set to 0.
