Closing All Windows
===================

**Description** 

When selecting the menu command File - Close All, all currently opened windows are closed, with the following exceptions:




*   Windows that are docked or floating are skipped.
*   Pages that have the state Keep open, are skipped.
*   Pages that 'Ignore the system close' are skipped (unless in Edit Mode).



If Pages or Attribute Windows are changed, you are asked to Save it; when you 'Cancel' this question, the Close All sequence is interrupted: i.e. no more windows are closed afterwards.
