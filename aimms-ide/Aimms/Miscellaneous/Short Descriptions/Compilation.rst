Compilation
===========

**Description** 

When you are developing a project in AIMMS, you will notice that AIMMS recompiles the model automatically, if needed. For example, when you make a change to the model and open a page, the model is recompiled. After the model is compiled, AIMMS always executes the procedure MainInitialization. You can also force AIMMS to do a recompile by selecting Compile All from the Run menu.
