Working with the Help System
============================

**Description** 

During the use of AIMMS, you will probably come up with a lot of questions about AIMMS, questions ranging from "What can I do with AIMMS?" to "How do I change the font in a table?". If you have global questions about the possibilities of AIMMS, or language related questions, it is advisable to have a look at the AIMMS Documentation. If you have specific questions about AIMMS features, you can use the on-line help system. There are different ways to get on-line help.



**Contents, Index, and Search** 

By selecting Contents and Index from the Help menu in any of the AIMMS windows, you will open this help file. 

On the Contents tab, you can browse through all available help in a tree structure. The contents tab always shows the position of the currently displayed help topic in the tree.

On the Index tab, you can look for keywords. For example, if you want help on "creating a table", you should enter "creating a table" in the search box. The first keyword that satisfies the search key, will be highlighted in the list of keywords.

On the Search tab, you can search on the occurrence of a specified word in help text. For example, if you want to read more about "security", you should search on that word and the search engine will list every help topic in which the word security occurs.



**Help on Window** 

By selecting Help on Window (F1) from the Help menu in any of the AIMMS windows, this help file will be opened, with help on the window that is active at that moment.



**Help on Page Objects** 

When a page is in edit mode, you can get help on an object on that page by selecting What's This? from the Help menu and clicking on the object. 



**Menu Help** 

By selecting What's This? from the Help menu and selecting a menu item, you will get help on that menu item. 



**Context Help in a Dialog Box** 

In any dialog box in AIMMS you can get help by clicking on the question mark in the upper right corner of the dialog box and clicking in the dialog box.



**Help in Attribute Windows** 

In the attribute windows in the model explorer, you can get help on AIMMS language topics by clicking the right mouse button and selecting Help On and the item on which you want help. This way you can get help on identifier types, identifier attributes, keywords, and pre-declared functions.
