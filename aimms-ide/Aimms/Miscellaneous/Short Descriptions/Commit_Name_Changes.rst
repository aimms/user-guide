Commit Name Changes
===================

**Description** 

When you rename identifiers in your model, AIMMS will save these name changes in a special file, the name change file. This name change file is used when pages, menu's and cases are opened. With the menu command Commit Name Changes from the Tools menu, you can let AIMMS open all pages and menu's automatically to save the name changes. This way you can make the name change file obsolete, as long as you have not yet saved data in cases or datasets.



**Remark** 

A typical moment to use this command is the last step of developing an application.
