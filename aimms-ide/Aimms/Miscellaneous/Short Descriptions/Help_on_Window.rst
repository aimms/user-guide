Help on Window
==============

**Description** 

Most AIMMS windows have a description in this help file. You can get help on a window by selecting the window and selecting Help on Window from the Help menu. Pages are a special case. On the general property tab of a page, you can associate a help topic with a page. With the option Application help file, you can associate a help file with your project. This allows an end-user to open a help file that the developer has created, describing the page that is currently active.
