Print Setup
===========

**Description** 

If you select Print Setup from the File menu, a standard Windows dialog box will appear in which you can select the current printer. Although you can also specify many other printer properties in this dialog, AIMMS will ignore most of them, because when printing pages or text files, AIMMS will use the settings specified in the Print Template or the Text Printing dialog box, respectively.
