Insert Current Data
===================

**Description** 

When you are editing in the model tree nodes, you have the possibility to add the current data of the identifier you are editing into the Definition or Initial Data attribute:

5.	Select the attribute field in which you want to insert the data.

6.	From the Edit menu, select Insert Current Data.

In the dialog box:

7.	Specify where you want to insert the data.

8.	(For a numerical identifier) Enter the number of decimals that you want to use.

9.	Click the OK button.



**Note** 

*	A similar result is achieved by using the wizard for the Definition or Initial Data attribute. This will first open a data page in which you can inspect and edit the current data for the identifier, and after closing this page the system will ask whether you want to insert the current data into the attribute.
