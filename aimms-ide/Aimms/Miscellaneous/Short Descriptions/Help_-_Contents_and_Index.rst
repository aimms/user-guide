Help - Contents and Index
=========================

**Description** 

In addition to getting direct help on a specific topic for the window that you are currently working with, you can also open the help file at the Contents or Index page. From there, you can browse to any topic that is of interest to you. You can do this by selecting Contents and Index from the Help menu.



**Note** 

*	If you have specified an Application help file and the project is in end-user mode, the application help file will be opened instead of the AIMMS help file.
