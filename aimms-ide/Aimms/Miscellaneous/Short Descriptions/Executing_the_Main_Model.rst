Executing the Main Model
========================

**Description** 

In AIMMS models executing the main model is the same as running the special procedure MainExecution. If your model has one major execution sequence (for example the solve of a mathematical program), then you can best place this in the procedure MainExecution. You can run the procedure MainExecution by simply selecting Main Model from the Run menu (or press F6).
