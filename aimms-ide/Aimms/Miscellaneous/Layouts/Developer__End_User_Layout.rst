Developer & End User Layout
===========================

AIMMS keeps track of two different layouts: the Developer layout and the End-User layout.




*   The Developer layout is intended as the layout that you are using while developing a model and creating the end user pages. During that process you want to setup the layout of all your development tools (like Model Explorer, Page Manager, etc) in such a way that you can work with them in the (for you) most convenient way.
*   The End-User layout is the layout in which an end-user of the application works. During development, you can switch to this layout to easily inspect how things look without all the development tools occupying space, and at the same time you can arrange the windows in this layout in such a way that you think is most convenient for your end-users to start with.



When you start the End-User version of AIMMS, the IDE will automatically switch to the End-User layout and the Developer layout is not available.



If, during development, you switch to the End-User layout you can still open any of the development specific tool windows, which will then become part of the layout. When you start an End-User version of AIMMS with an end-user layout containing a development specific tool, then that tool will be closed automatically, and thus not appear.



In the developer version of AIMMS, you can switch between the two layouts using the **Windows - Layout**  menu.
