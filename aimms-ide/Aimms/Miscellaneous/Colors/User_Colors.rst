User Colors
===========

**Description** 

You can associate a name with a color. 
The advantage of using User Colors in page objects instead of System Colors is that 
you can change the colors in your whole model by changing the colors in the User Colors dialog box.
Another advantage is that you are sure to have exactly the same color, without having to compare RGB values.

**Remark** 

The language is equipped with four interface functions, UserColorAdd, UserColorDelete, UserColorGetRGB, and UserColorModify that allow you to add and modify user colors.
