User Colors Dialog Box
======================

**Description** 

In the User Colors dialog box you can manage the list of User Colors. Each user color consists of a name and a specific RGB color. The list of User Colors corresponds to the predefined set AllColors in your model, this allows you to declare element parameters in this set AllColors which in turn can be used as a valid color reference in a page (object). Of course you can also reference the user colors directly from within your page.



Similarly as with font names, you are encouraged to choose functional rather than color-describing names for user colors. For instance, colors named "Thresh-old Exceeded" and "Below Threshold" are, from a maintenance point-of-view, much better than such simple names as "Red" and "Black". In addition, choosing descriptive names will make the intention of any assignment or definition to color parameters in your model also much clearer.
