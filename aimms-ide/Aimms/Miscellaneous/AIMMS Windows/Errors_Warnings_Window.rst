Errors & Warnings Window
========================

**Description** 

In this window compile and execution errors and warnings are displayed. You can select Go To Error from the Edit Menu (or double click on the error), to see where in the model the error occurs. You can select Entire Message from the Edit Menu to see the entire message on screen.



**Note** 

*	The errors and warnings will automatically be removed from the list if the part of the model in which the error occurred is recompiled. You can manually remove any error or warning via the Delete command in the Edit menu.
*	In some situations it might not be possible to look at the Errors & Warnings Window, for example when executing AIMMS with the AIMMS COM object. Errors and warnings that normally would show up in the Errors & Warnings Window are also written to the files messages.log and aimms.err in the log folder of the AIMMS project.
