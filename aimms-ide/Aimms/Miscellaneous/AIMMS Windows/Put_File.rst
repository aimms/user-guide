Put Window
==========

**Description** 

With the PUT statement in AIMMS you can write data from your model to specific text files. These so-called "Put Files" can be opened in a text editor by selecting Open â€“ Put File from the File menu. This opens a dialog box in which you can select a specific put file from the list of all put files currently known in the model.



**Note** 

*	Only globally declared put files are shown in the list.
*	You can also redirect the output from put statements to a window.
