New Project Window
==================

**Description** 

The new project dialog box assists you in creating a new AIMMS project. In the dialog box you specify a project name, a model name and the directory in which you want to create the project. Usually, you only have to enter the name of the new project, because AIMMS will automatically fill in the directory and model name.



**Remark** 

As long as you use the directory that is displayed initially, or pick another directory using the wizard button, the directory name is automatically extended with a subdirectory name that is derived from the project name that you enter. This feature helps you to easily create a separate directory for each AIMMS project (which is strongly recommended). If you do not want AIMMS to automatically create the directory name, then you should modify this directory name manually.
