.. rubric:: Interface localization

When you are creating an end-user interface around your modeling
application, you will most likely create the end-user interface in
either your native language or in a common language like English. Which
language you choose most probably depends on the intended user group of
your application. In the case that you are requested to distribute your
application to end-users who are not fluent in the language in which you
originally developed the end-user interface, AIMMS offers a localization
procedure which automatically separates all static texts used in the
end-user interface of your application. This allows you to provide a
relatively smooth translation path of your application to the native
language(s) of your end-users.



This chapter illustrates how to use the automated localization procedure
built into AIMMS, and explains how you can use it to create a foreign
version of an end-user application.
