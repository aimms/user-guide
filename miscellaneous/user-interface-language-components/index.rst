User Interface Language Components
==================================



Most of the functionality in the AIMMS graphical user interface that is
relevant to end-users of your modeling application can be accessed
directly from within the AIMMS modeling language. This chapter discusses
the functions and identifiers in AIMMS that you can use within your
model

-  to influence the appearance and behavior of data shown in your
   end-user interface, or

-  to provide (or re-define) direct interaction with the end-user
   interface through dialog boxes, menus and buttons.

Rather than providing a complete reference of all these functions, this
chapter provides you with a global overview of the functions available
per functional category. A complete function reference is made available
as part of the AIMMS documentation in :doc:`user-interface-related-functions/index`.
