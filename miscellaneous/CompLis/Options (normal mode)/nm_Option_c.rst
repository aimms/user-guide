Option 'c'
==========

**Usage** :	CompLis <filename1> <filename2> -c	



If this option is set then CompLis will check whether the level values and lower and upper bounds of the variables are consistent throughout the constraint listings in both listing files.



Note that the level values and lower and upper bounds of all variables are consistent in a normal AIMMS constraint listing. Since this check is time consuming it is therefore skipped by default.



If this option is set then CompLis will automatically compare the level values and the lower and upper bounds of the variables.
