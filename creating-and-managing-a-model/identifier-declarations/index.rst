Identifier Declarations
=======================



This chapter shows you how to add new identifier declarations using the
**Model Explorer** and how to modify existing identifier declarations.
The chapter also explains how any changes you make to either the name or
the domain of an identifier are propagated throughout the remainder of
your model.
