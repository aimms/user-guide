Procedures and Functions
========================



This chapter describes how you can add procedures and functions to a
model. It also shows how you can add arguments and local identifiers to
procedures and functions. In addition, it illustrates how the body of a
procedure or function can be broken down into smaller pieces of
execution code, allowing you to implement procedures and functions in a
top-down approach.
