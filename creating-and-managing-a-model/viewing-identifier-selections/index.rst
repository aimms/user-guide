Viewing Identifier Selections
=============================

.. rubric:: Identifier overviews

Although the **Model Explorer** is a very convenient tool to organize
all the information in your model, it does not allow you to obtain a
simultaneous overview of a group of identifiers that share certain
aspects of your model. By mutual comparison of important attributes
(such as the definition), such overviews may help you to further
structure and edit the contents of your model, or to discover oversights
in a formulation.



To assist you in creating overviews that can help you analyze the
interrelationships between identifiers in your model, AIMMS offers the
**Identifier Selector** tool and **View** windows. This chapter helps
you understand how to create meaningful identifier selections with the
**Identifier Selector**, and how to display such selections using
different views.
