The Math Program Inspector
==========================

.. _mp_inspector:



In this chapter you will find the description of an extensive facility
to analyze both the input and output of a generated optimization model.
This mathematical program inspector allows you to make custom selections
of constraints and variables. For each such selection, you can inspect
statistics of the corresponding matrix and the corresponding solution.
The main purpose of the math program inspector, however, is to assist
you in finding causes of infeasibility, unboundedness and unrealistic
solutions.

.. rubric:: Acknowledgement

The design and contents of the math program inspector is strongly
influenced by the papers and contributions of Bruce A. McCarl on
misbehaving mathematical programs. The example in the last section of
this chapter is a direct reference to his work.
