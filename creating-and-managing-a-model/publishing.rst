Distributing an AIMMS app
==========================

A complete AIMMS application consists of several files, 
all of which should also be distributed to the user of the application. 
To make the distribution of an AIMMS application easier, 
AIMMS offers the possibility to distribute your project as an end-user application, 
by packing all relevant files into a single file with the ``.aimmspack`` extension, 
and publishing your app to an AIMMS :doc:`pro/index`. We also provide a :doc:`cloud/index` 
where this AIMMS PRO platform is already installed, maintained and scalable.

To prepare and publish your app, please refer to :doc:`Articles/33/33-pro-deploy-app`
