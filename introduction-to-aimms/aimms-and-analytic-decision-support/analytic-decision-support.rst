Analytic decision support
=========================

.. rubric:: Analytic decision support

Analytic decision support applications are usually interactive decision
support systems with a strong internal emphasis on *advanced
computational techniques* and that pertain to extensive problem analysis
on the outside. They typically

-  represent a complex and large-scale reality,

-  organize and use large amounts of interrelated multidimensional data
   based on corporate and market information,

-  use advanced arithmetic manipulations and/or optimization tools to
   find a solution,

-  apply analytic techniques or perform "what-if" experiments to assess
   the consequences of making a decision under different scenarios,

-  employ advanced visualization techniques to provide an insight into
   the solution and/or the problem complexity, and

-  are subject to permanent change due to a changing reality or improved
   insights.

.. rubric:: Increasing market need

With the world becoming daily more complex, decision makers around the
world are in search of advanced decision support tools. Such tools can
help them get insights into their decision problems, monitor the
consequences of previous decisions, and help them take new decisions on
a regular basis. There is substantial evidence that analytic decision
support applications are becoming increasingly popular throughout
industry and government, as the improved decisions generated by ADS
applications imply increased profit and/or efficiency.

.. rubric:: Supporting developments

A number of major developments in the last decade have increased the
suitability of analytic decision support to tackle such problems:

-  corporate databases are becoming increasingly mature and allow a
   quick follow-up to market changes,

-  the increasing speed of PCs allows interactive use, even with complex
   applications,

-  the visually attractive and convenient presentation using the
   standardized and user-friendly Windows environment makes complex
   processes more accessible to decision makers, and

-  the availability of standardized and improved optimization tools
   allows ADS application developers to specify the problem without
   having to specify a complicated algorithm to solve it.

.. rubric:: Applicable problem areas

Analytic decision support lends itself to a wide variety of decision
support problems. The following list provides a non-exhaustive overview
of the areas in which analytic decision support is applicable:

-  strategic and tactical planning of resources in industry and
   government,

-  operational scheduling of machines, vehicles, product flow and
   personnel,

-  strategic evaluation studies in the areas of energy, environment,
   forestry and social policies,

-  financial decision-making to support asset-liability management,

-  economic decision-making to control market clearing and economic
   development, and

-  technical decision-making to support the design and calibration of
   systems and objects.
